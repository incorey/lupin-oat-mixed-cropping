<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Amongst all attributes analysed, the following response variables exhibited significant effects of mixed cropping compared with pure stands: soil coverage, cereal leaf beetle of oats, ears emergence in oats, height of oats in mid-May, weed volumes in NLL and oats, plant growth stage at harvest of NLL and oat (<a href="#tbl_onfield">Table 6</a>), oats and NLL protein yield, partial protein overyielding and the (partial) LERs (Figure 5), as well as thousand kernel weight, hectolitre weight and protein content of oats (<a href="#tbl_offfield">Table 7</a>). In contrast, mixed cropping showed no effect on the following attributes: lodging of NLL, plant heights of NLL, NLL plant developmental stage at flowering, plant height of oat in June and July, tiller number of oats, crown rust of oats (<em>Puccinia coronata</em>), anthracnose of NLL (<em>Colletotrichum lupini</em>), chlorosis of NLL, NLL indeterminacy, thousand kernel weight of NLL grains, protein content of NLL grains, and total protein overyielding. The following four subchapters shed light on the response variables listed above, divided into plant development, plant health, productivity and crop quality. The full analytical output is provided as Appendix A in the supplemental materials.</p>

<p>The reported significant effects in the following two subchapters on plant development and plant health are summarised in <a href="#tbl_onfield">Table 6</a>.</p>
<section id="plant-development" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plant-development">Plant development</h3>
<p>The mixed stands covered the soil on average 19.8 days earlier than pure oats, whereas there was no significant difference between the soil coverage in pure and mixed stands of all NLL varieties. The individual NLL varieties differed moderately but significantly (p &lt; 0.05), in terms of the date, when the soil was covered: On average, across both years and sites, Lunabor established a full canopy cover 3 days sooner than Jowisz, and 7 days sooner than Probor.</p>
<p>No difference in NLL flowering was observed between pure and mixed stands. However, the oat ears emerged significantly later in mixture than in pure stands. The strongest effect was observed in Troll and Lion with a two-day delay (p &lt; 0.05), followed by Lion with a single day later onset of ears emergence in mixed, relative to pure stands, respectively. For the plants’ mutual maturity in mixed stands, the linear mixed-effect models showed an average delay of 2.4 growth stages of the oat crop compared with the growth stage of the NLL crop. However, this effect was more prominent in the year 2023, whereas the effect of the year 2022 resulted in near-coincidental maturity, i.e.&nbsp;in 2022, both crops became ripe during the same days, whereas in 2023 there was a slight delay of the oat crop. The NLL’s indeterminacy was not affected by mixed cropping and the indeterminacy was low, ranging from 1 to 3%.</p>
<p>Amongst the recorded time series of plant heights spanning between May and July, only the oat height in May differed between pure and mixed stands, where Bison was on average 9.9 cm, Lion 8.7 cm and Troll 6.6 cm shorter in mixed than in pure stands (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, in June and July, no mixed cropping effect onto the plant heights of oats and NLL was uncovered. The average height difference of oats to NLL amounted to 10, 31 and 43 cm in May, June, and July respectively, whereby in June and July, Troll was significantly shorter than Bison and Lion (p &lt; 0.01). In the oat crops, there was no lodging present at all and in the NLL crop, no significant effect of mixed cropping was detected. The number of oat tillers was also not affected by mixed cropping. However, the site Reckenholz showed a 10% higher number of oat tillers across both pure and mixed stands (0.24 more tillers per plant, p &lt; 0.001).</p>

<p>Amongst the scored pests and diseases, only crown rust (<em>Puccinia coronata</em>) and cereal leaf beetle (<em>Oulema ssp.</em>) population exceeded the interference threshold <span class="citation" data-cites="zotero-498">[@zotero-498]</span>, and only cereal leaf beetles exhibited a significant mixed cropping response.</p>
<p>The cereal leaf beetles showed higher incidences on pure stands of Lion and Troll (p &lt; 0.05), compared with their respective mixed stands, whereas the cereal leaf beetle incidence did not differ significantly between pure and mixed stands of Bison. The changes reported in <a href="#tbl_onfield">Table 6</a> correspond to a reduction of the cereal leaf beetle incidence of 41% for Lion and 46% for Troll when mixed with NLL (p &lt; 0.05). The linear mixed-effect models showed a strong year effect exceeding the mixed cropping effect (p &lt; 0.001): In 2022, the overall incidence was significantly lower, and no recorded median exceeded the interference threshold, whereas in 2023, this case occurred for the pure stands of Troll. In 2022, the reduction of the cereal leaf beetle’s incidence was more consistent but at a lower level, and in 2023, mixed cropping led to a relevant reduction of the incidence on the oat variety Troll (<strong>Figure 3</strong>) to levels below the interference threshold according to Swiss farming practices <span class="citation" data-cites="zotero-498">[@zotero-498]</span>.</p>

<p>The dominant weed species (presence in over 33% of all scored plots) were wild mustard (<em>Sinapis arvensis</em>) in Reckenholz 2022, field poppy (<em>Papaver rhoeas</em>) in Reckenholz 2023, and cleavers (<em>Galium aparine</em>) in Seegräben in both years. The weed volumes were significantly lower in mixed NLL stands than in pure stands, whereby the relative reduction in weed volume in mixed NLL treatments amounted to up to 87% (p &lt; 0.005, Table 6). The relative increase of the recorded weed volumes in mixed oats was proportional to the relative decreases in mixed NLL compared with their respective pure stands. The weed volumes in pure stands of oats were two orders of magnitude lower than the weed volumes in pure stands of NLL (Figure 4).</p>

<p>The median NLL yields of Lunabor, Probor and Jowisz in pure stands were 3.1, 3.3 and 3.0 t·ha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The median oat yields of Bison, Lion and Troll in pure stands amounted to 4.9, 5.4 and 5.2 t·ha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Figure 5A). A significant year (p &lt; 0.005) and site effect (p &lt; 0.005) was observed in both the NLL and oat yields: In 2022, the overall NLL yield was 0.96 t·ha<sup>-1</sup> higher, and the overall oat yield 0.36 t·ha<sup>-1</sup> lower than in 2023. Across both years, the site Reckenholz, compared with Seegräben, showed an overall reduction of the NLL yield by 1.1 t·ha<sup>-1</sup> (p &lt; 0.01), whereas the overall oat yield was elevated by 0.75 t·ha<sup>-1</sup> (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p>The land use efficiency of the studied mixtures showed the following picture: Across all nine mixtures, only Lunabor mixed with Troll exhibited a significantly elevated LER amounting to 1.16, i.e.&nbsp;this mixture used land 16% more efficiently than its corresponding pure stands. The LER of all other mixtures did not differ significantly from 1, which meant their land use in mixed stands was as efficient as in pure stands. Across all mixtures, the pLERs of the oats were significantly above their expected LER (corresponding to their sowing ratio) of 0.1 (p &lt; 0.001), with significantly different values between the three oat varieties in the decreasing order of Lion, Bison and Troll (p &lt; 0.001). The pLER of the NLL was significantly below their expected pLER of 0.9 in case of the mixtures Jowisz x Bison, Jowisz x Lion and Probor x Lion (p &lt; 0.05), all other NLL pLERs did not differ significantly from their expected value (Figure 5B). A pronounced year effect was apparent, where in 2022 the pLER of NLL was 0.16 higher and the pLER of oats was 0.12 lower than in 2023 (p &lt; 0.001). The significant site effect manifested itself in a reduction of the pLER of NLL by 0.26 and an increase of the pLER of oats by 0.13 in Reckenholz, compared with Seegräben (p &lt; 0.001). Altogether, these differences in the pLERs resulted in a LER-change of -0.13 in Reckenholz compared with Seegräben (p &lt; 0.001), without a significant year effect.</p>
<p>The protein yield of pure stands was significantly higher in NLL than in oats (p &lt; 0.001). The absolute protein yield of the two NLL varieties Probor and Jowisz was 272 and 282 kg·ha<sup>-1</sup> lower in mixed stands compared with their pure stands (p &lt; 0.001), respectively, whereas Lunabor did not show any significant reduction. The total protein yield per hectare did not vary significantly between the three pure stands of the NLL and all mixtures, adding up to 900 - 1150 kg·ha<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 5C). However, a strong site and year effect was also observed in case of the total protein yield of the NLL: In 2023, the protein yield in Reckenholz was 262 kg·ha<sup>-1</sup> lower than in Seegräben (p &lt; 0.0001), which also resulted in an overall increased protein yield in the year 2022 across both sites of 159 kg·ha<sup>-1</sup> (p &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p>The linear mixed-effect models did not reveal any significant difference of the TOI<sub>protein</sub> from 1. This implies an absence of transgressive protein overyielding, i.e.&nbsp;the protein yield per hectare was identical in mixed stands with the protein yield of pure NLL stands, which was the crop producing higher protein yield in pure stands. However, with regards to the expected pTOI<sub>protein</sub>, the oats yielded more than their expected value of 0.1, corresponding to their sowing proportion of 10% (p &lt; 0.01). This effect was observed across all oat varieties and the measured median pTOI<sub>protein, oat</sub> amounted to 0.22. The pTOI<sub>protein, NLL</sub> showed variable responses in comparison to their expected pTOI<sub>protein, NLL</sub> of 0.9: Lunabor in mixture with Bison, and all NLL mixed with the oat variety Troll were not significantly different from the expected value, whereas the remaining five pTOI<sub>protein, NLL</sub> of the NLL were significantly lower than the expected value (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, a significantly lower pTOI<sub>protein, NLL</sub> of Jowisz, compared with Lunabor was observed (p &lt; 0.005) (Figure 5D).</p>

<p>The yield bufferings analysis revealed a pronounced inverse relationship between the two mixed crop partners: Partial NLL and oat yields from mixed plots moved in opposite directions across both sites and years (Pearson r = –0.73, p &lt; 0.001; Figure 6). Hence, whenever the NLL yield component declined, the oat yield component increased, and vice-versa, underscoring the underlying compensatory behaviour in the mixed cropping. This stabilising behaviour of the mixed cropping system, which was observed on an individual plot basis, and was reported on a field and year basis above, exemplifies the higher yield-stability of the mixed cropping system in comparison to their pure stands, where no second crop can compensate for the yield loss.</p>

<p>The NLL grain quality remained unaffected by mixed cropping, as their protein content and thousand kernel weight (TKW) did not differ between the pure and the mixed stands. On the other hand, the oat grains exhibited strong mixed cropping responses, with an increase in their TKWs of 2.1 up to 4.1 g (p &lt; 0.001), compared with pure stands, representing a relative increase of up to 10%. Further, the oats hectolitre weight increased by 1.5 up to 1.9 kghl<sup>-1</sup>, compared with pure stands (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, compared with the pure stands, the oats protein content increased by 2.1 up to 3.2% of the total weight, which corresponded to a relative increase in their protein content of 27%, 21% and 31% for Bison, Lion and Troll, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Across both years and sites, an overall reduction of 2.2% in the absolute protein content of the oats became apparent in Reckenholz in the year 2023 (p &lt; 0.001). The reported significant mixed cropping effects on yield quality are summarised in Table 7.</p>
