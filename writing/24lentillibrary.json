  {"id":"adhikari2009","abstract":"Anthracnose is a major disease of lupins in Western Australia (WA). The disease wiped out the WA albus lupin industry in 1996 and since then, anthracnose resistance has been a major focus for WA lupin breeding. In an endeavour to find a source of resistance to anthracnose, all available germplasm in WA was screened against anthracnose in New Zealand over the summer of 1997 and 1998, and resistance was identified in Ethiopian landraces. The resistance was present in many Ethiopian landraces within a close geographical distribution, suggesting a similar genetic basis of resistance. Crosses were made between the resistant landraces and agronomically superior lines. The progeny were tested for anthracnose resistance, yield, seed quality, and other agronomic characters. The most superior line, Andromeda, was released for commercial production in WA. It was developed from an F3-derived single-plant selection of a cross between an anthracnose-resistant landrace P27175 from Ethiopia and a well adapted but highly susceptible WA breeding line 89B10A-14. Andromeda has a significantly higher level of resistance to anthracnose than the previous cv. Kiev Mutant and is recommended in the medium- to low-rainfall area of the northern wheatbelt of WA. Further breeding effort has resulted in significant improvement in the level of resistance within the WA breeding program, and early generation lines are more resistant than advanced lines. The best resistant lines are, however, in a late flowering background and only an incremental improvement has been achieved in combining early flowering with anthracnose resistance, which seems to be a complex process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Adhikari","given":"K.

  {"id":"adhikari2013","abstract":"White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is an important grain legume crop in Australia. The anthracnose incursion in the mid-1990s wiped out the white lupin industry in Western Australia (WA). Since then, incorporation of anthracnose resistance has been a major focus in white lupin breeding. After a series of experiments and targeted breeding in WA, high-yielding anthracnose-resistant genotypes were developed. One of these lines, Amira, was released in 2012 as a replacement for the then-benchmark variety Andromeda. Amira is high-yielding and early-maturing and it has substantially improved resistance to anthracnose compared with Andromeda. Its yield and grain quality are similar to Kiev Mutant and it will be suitable for growing in parts of the Northern Agricultural Region of WA where anthracnose risk is moderate to low. With the adoption of this new variety, reliable production of white lupin can recommence in WA. The growing season in WA is characterised by terminal drought, and early flowering is as important as anthracnose resistance. However, combining these traits was difficult and their combination was not achieved at a desired level in earlier work. The incorporation of the early-flowering trait from a different genetic source from France demonstrated that it is possible to combine these traits at an appropriate level. There was no genetic linkage between the two traits, and consequently, new genotypes with earlier phenology and higher levels of resistance than Amira were developed. The combination of early flowering and anthracnose resistance represents a breakthrough that will significantly improve the adaptation and profitability of white lupin production in WA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Adhikari","given":"Kedar Nath"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Geoff"},{"family":"Diepeveen","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Trethowan","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"adhikari2013","container-title":"Crop and Pasture Science","container-title-short":"Crop Pasture Sci.","DOI":"10.1071/CP13249","ISSN":"1836-0947","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"914","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Overcoming the barriers of combining early flowering and anthracnose resistance in white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) for the Northern Agricultural Region of Western Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=CP13249","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"czepiel2021","abstract":"The main restraint obstructing the wider adoption of lupins as protein crops is the presence of bitter and toxic quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs), whose contents might increase under exposure to stressful environmental conditions. A poor understanding of how QAs accumulate hinders the breeding of sweet varieties. Here, we characterize the expression proﬁles of QA-related genes, along with the alkaloid content, in various organs of sweet and bitter narrow-leafed lupin (NLL, Lupinus angustifolius L.). Special attention is paid to the RAP2-7 transcription factor, a candidate regulator of the QA pathway. We demonstrate the upregulation of RAP2-7 and other QA-related genes, across the aerial organs of a bitter cultivar and the signiﬁcant correlations between their expression levels, thus supporting the role of RAP2-7 as an important regulatory gene in NLL. Moreover, we showed that the initial steps of QA synthesis might occur independently in all aerial plant organs sharing common regulatory mechanisms. Nonetheless, other regulatory steps might be involved in RAP27-triggered QA accumulation, given its expression pattern in leaves. Finally, the examination of QA-related gene expression in plants infected with Colletotrichum lupini evidenced no connection between QA synthesis and anthracnose resistance, in contrast to the important role of polyamines during plant–pathogen interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Czepiel","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Krajewski","given":"Paweł"},{"family":"Wilczura","given":"Paulina"},{"family":"Bielecka","given":"Patrycja"},{"family":"Święcicki","given":"Wojciech"},{"family":"Kroc","given":"Magdalena"}],"citation-key":"czepiel2021","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22052676","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"2676","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Expression Profiles of Alkaloid-Related Genes across the Organs of Narrow-Leafed Lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) and in Response to Anthracnose Infection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/5/2676","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"frick2017","abstract":"Quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are toxic secondary metabolites found within the genus Lupinus, some species of which are commercially important grain legume crops including Lupinus angustifolius (narrow-leafed lupin, NLL), L. luteus (yellow lupin), L. albus (white lupin), and L. mutabilis (pearl lupin), with NLL grain being the most largely produced of the four species in Australia and worldwide. While QAs offer the plants protection against insect pests, the accumulation of QAs in lupin grain complicates its use for food purposes as QA levels must remain below the industry threshold (0.02%), which is often exceeded. It is not well understood what factors cause grain QA levels to exceed this threshold. Much of the early work on QA biosynthesis began in the 1970–1980s, with many QA chemical structures well-characterized and lupin cell cultures and enzyme assays employed to identify some biosynthetic enzymes and pathway intermediates. More recently, two genes associated with these enzymes have been characterized, however, the QA biosynthetic pathway remains only partially elucidated. Here, we review the research accomplished thus far concerning QAs in lupin and consider some possibilities for further elucidation and manipulation of the QA pathway in lupin crops, drawing on examples from model alkaloid species. One breeding strategy for lupin is to produce plants with high QAs in vegetative tissues while low in the grain in order to confer insect resistance to plants while keeping grain QA levels within industry regulations. With the knowledge achieved on alkaloid biosynthesis in other plant species in recent years, and the recent development of genomic and transcriptomic resources for NLL, there is considerable scope to facilitate advances in our knowledge of QAs, leading to the production of improved lupin crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Frick","given":"Karen M."},{"family":"Kamphuis","given":"Lars G."},{"family":"Siddique","given":"Kadambot H.

The genotypic and environmental influences on QA production in NLL are poorly understood. Here, the expression of QA biosynthetic genes was analysed in vegetative and reproductive tissues of bitter (high QA) and sweet (low QA) accessions. It was demonstrated that sweet accessions are characterized by lower QA biosynthetic gene expression exclusively in leaf and stem tissues than bitter NLL, consistent with the hypothesis that QAs are predominantly produced in aerial tissues and transported to seeds, rather than synthesized within the seed itself. This analysis informed our identification of additional candidate genes involved in QA biosynthesis. Drought and temperature stress are two major abiotic stresses that often occur during NLL pod set. Hence, we assessed the effect of drought, increased temperature, and their combination, on QA production in three sweet NLL cultivars. A cultivar‐specific response to drought and temperature in grain QA levels was observed, including the identification of a cultivar where alkaloid levels did not change with these stress treatments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Frick","given":"Karen M."},{"family":"Foley","given":"Rhonda C."},{"family":"Kamphuis","given":"Lars G."},{"family":"Siddique","given":"Kadambot H.M."},{"family":"Garg","given":"Gagan"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Karam B."}],"citation-key":"frick2018","container-title":"Plant, Cell & Environment","container-title-short":"Plant Cell Environ","DOI":"10.1111/pce.13172","ISSN":"0140-7791, 1365-3040","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","page":"2155-2168","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Characterization of the genetic factors affecting quinolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis and its response to abiotic stress in narrow‐leafed lupin ( <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\"> <i>Lupinus angustifolius</i> </span> L.)","title-short":"Characterization of the genetic factors affecting quinolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis and its response to abiotic stress in narrow‐leafed lupin ( <span style=\"font-variant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pce.13172","volume":"41"},

A second experiment was performed in the green house at different temperatures (10, 20 and 30 °C) using one cultivar in 2006. This experiment conﬁrmed the results of the ﬁeld experiments as higher temperatures resulted in a higher alkaloid content of the seeds. In a third temperature stress experiment, three cultivars were grown under long day conditions at day/night temperatures of 30 °C/ 16 °C and 20 °C/16 °C in growth chambers in comparison with an outdoor control at mean temperatures of 15.5 °C. Like in the other experiments, the seed alkaloid content increased with rising temperature. From these results, it may be concluded that the seed alkaloid content is strongly inﬂuenced by the temperature during initiation of ﬂowering up to pod ripening. This has to be taken into account e.g. in trials for cultivar release in which the alkaloid content is a knock-out criterion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jansen","given":"G."},{"family":"Jürgens","given":"H.‐U."},{"family":"Ordon","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"jansen2009","container-title":"Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science","container-title-short":"J Agronomy Crop Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1439-037X.2008.00356.x","ISSN":"0931-2250, 1439-037X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","page":"172-177","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of Temperature on the Alkaloid Content of Seeds of <i>Lupinus angustifolius</i> Cultivars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-037X.2008.00356.x","volume":"195"},

  {"id":"lucas2015","abstract":"Europe has become heavily dependent on soya bean imports, entailing trade agreements and quality standards that do not satisfy the European citizen’s expectations. White, yellow, and narrow-leafed lupins are native European legumes that can become true alternatives to soya bean, given their elevated and high-quality protein content, potential health benefits, suitability for sustainable production, and acceptability to consumers. Nevertheless, lupin cultivation in Europe remains largely insufficient to guarantee a steady supply to the food industry, which in turn must innovate to produce attractive lupin-based protein-rich foods. Here, we address different aspects of the food supply chain that should be considered for lupin exploitation as a high-value protein source. Advanced breeding techniques are needed to provide new lupin varieties for socio-economically and environmentally sustainable cultivation. Novel processes should be optimized to obtain high-quality, safe lupin protein ingredients, and marketable foods need to be developed and offered to consumers. With such an integrated strategy, lupins can be established as an alternative protein crop, capable of promoting socio-economic growth and environmental benefits in Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucas","given":"M.

  {"id":"namdar2024","abstract":"Alkaloids play an essential role in protecting plants against herbivores. Humans can also benefit from the pharmacological effects of these compounds. Plants produce an immense variety of structurally different alkaloids, including quinolizidine alkaloids, a group of bi-, tri-, and tetracyclic compounds produced by Lupinus species. Various lupin species produce different alkaloid profiles. To study the composition of quinolizidine alkaloids in lupin seeds, we collected 31 populations of two wild species native to Israel, L. pilosus and L. palaestinus, and analyzed their quinolizidine alkaloid contents. Our goal was to study the alkaloid profiles of these two wild species to better understand the challenges and prospective uses of wild lupins. We compared their profiles with those of other commercial and wild lupin species. To this end, a straightforward method for extracting alkaloids from seeds and determining the quinolizidine alkaloid profile by LC–MS/MS was developed and validated in-house. For the quantification of quinolizidine alkaloids, 15 analytical reference standards were used. We used GC–MS to verify and cross-reference the identity of certain alkaloids for which no analytical standards were available. The results enabled further exploration of quinolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis. We reviewed and re-analyzed the suggested quinolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis pathway, including the relationship between the amino acid precursor l-lysine and the different quinolizidine alkaloids occurring in seeds of lupin species. Revealing alkaloid compositions and highlighting some aspects of their formation pathway are important steps in evaluating the use of wild lupins as a novel legume crop.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Namdar","given":"Dvory"},{"family":"Mulder","given":"Patrick P.

  {"id":"palmason1992","abstract":"Nitrogen fixation was measured in monocropped sweet-blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), lupin intercropped with two ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) cultivars or with oats (Avena sativa) on an Andosol soil, using the ISN isotope dilution method. At 117 days after planting and at a mean temperature below 10°C, monocropped lupin derived an average of 92% or 195 kg N ha- 1of its N from N~ fixation. Intercropping lupin with cereals increased (p < 0.05) the percentage of N derived from atmospheric N 2 (% Ndfa) to a mean of 96%. Compared to the monocropped, total N fixed per hectare in intercropped lupin declined approximately 50%, in line with the decrease in seeding rate and dry matter yield. With these high values of N 2 fixation, selection of the reference crop was not a problem; all the cereals, intercropped or grown singly produced similar estimates of N 2 fixed in lupin. It was deduced from the ~SN data that significant N transfer occurred from lupin to intercropped Italian ryegrass but not to intercropped Westerwoldian ryegrass or to oats. Doubling the ~SN fertilizer rate from 30 to 60 kg N ha ~decreased % Ndfa to 86% (p < 0.05), but total N fixed was unaltered. These results indicate that lupin has a high potential for N 2 fixation at low temperatures, and can maintain higher rates of N 2 fixation in soils of high N than many other forage and pasture legumes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Pálmason","given":"F."},{"family":"Danso","given":"S.

  {"id":"vishnyakova2020","abstract":"Narrow-leaved lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.), a valuable leguminous crop adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions, has a very short history of domestication. For many centuries it was used mainly as a green manure, since the success and prospects of the multi-purpose use of the species depend on its breeding improvement, in particular, on a particular concentration of alkaloids in seeds and green mass. The first varieties of scientific breeding were created only in the 1930s after the appearance of low-alkaloid mutants. Despite wide prospects for use in various areas of the national economy, unstable productivity and susceptibility to diseases hinder the production of this crop. Obviously, breeders deal only with a small part of the gene pool of the species and limited genetic resources, using mainly low-alkaloid (sweet) genotypes to create new varieties. The genetic potential of the species can be used more efficiently. At the same time, it is rational to create highly alkaloid (bitter) varieties for green manure, while food and feed varie­ties should not lose their adaptive potential, in particular, resistance to pathogens, due to the elimination of alkaloids. In this regard, it seems to be a productive idea to create ‘bitter/sweet’ varieties combining a high content of alkaloids in the vegetative organs and low in seeds, which can be achieved by regulating the synthesis/transport of alkaloids in the plant. The paper discusses the current state of use of the species as a green manure, fodder, food plant. Information is given on the quantity and qualitative composition of narrow-leaved lupine alkaloids, their applied value, in particular, fungicidal, antibacterial, insecticidal, the use of lupine alkaloids as active principles of drugs. Along with promising breeding considerations, the possibility of using technologies for processing raw high-alkaloid materials with the accompanying extraction of valuable ingredients for pharmaceuticals is discussed. Information is briefly presented about the genomic resources of the species and the prospects for their use in marker-assistant selection and genome editing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vishnyakova","given":"M.

  {"id":"warton2005","abstract":"An important step in studying the ecology of a species is choosing a statistical model of abundance; however, there has been little general consideration of which statistical model to use. In particular, abundance data have many zeros (often 50–80 per cent of all values), and zero-inflated count distributions are often used to specifically model the high frequency of zeros in abundance data. However, in such cases it is often taken for granted that a zero-inflated model is required, and the goodness-of-fit to count distributions with and without zero inflation is not often compared for abundance data.","author":[{"family":"Warton","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"warton2005","container-title":"Environmetrics","container-title-short":"Environmetrics","DOI":"10.1002/env.702","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",5,1]]},"page":"275-289","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Many zeros does not mean zero inflation: Comparing the goodness-of-fit of parametric models to multivariate abundance data","title-short":"Many zeros does not mean zero inflation","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

In contrast to the diurnal alkaloid formation, this reaction takes place both in the light and the dark and even at 4°C. The effect is reduced in chloramphenicol-treated samples but unimpaired in cycloheximide-treated assays.
