# Introduction

Agricultural systems simultaneously act as drivers of climate change, through greenhouse gas emissions and land-use change, and as sensitive receptors, with productivity and resilience increasingly threatened by climate-related stressors, in particular heterogenic weather events [@yamanoshita2025]. One strategy to mitigate this bidirectional impact is to diversify agricultural production [@lin2011]. By incorporating a wider range of crops alongside the primary staples, diversification enhances the resilience of agricultural systems to climate extremes [@renard2019]. Different crops exhibit varying physiological and ecological responses to abiotic and biotic stress factors, reducing the system's overall vulnerability and leading to greater yield stability compared with monoculture systems [@gaudin2015].

Amongst the macronutrients fats, carbohydrates and proteins, the latter are the ones that require the highest amount of energy to be synthesised per weight unit [@tegeder2018]. This high energy expenditure is attributed to the high nitrogen content of proteins, and the energy-intense metabolic pathways in the plant required to produce amino-acids [@hildebrandt2015]. Additionally, producing nitrogen in an accessible form, either through the Haber-Bosch synthesis or the nitrogen-fixation, requires large amounts of energy [@erisman2008; @vitousek2013].

Despite these costs to protein production, the global protein demand is still rising and expected to grow at a rate of 8% per annum, which implies further sustainable protein sources need to be opened [@kim2019; @aschemann-witzel2021]. In the light of agricultural diversification and a growing protein demand, narrow-leaved lupins (NLL) can play a relevant role in producing large amounts of sustainable protein [@lucas2015]. NLL contain up to 40% of high-quality protein in their harvested grains, and their protein exhibits a high biological value for human consumption, which is comparable to that of soybean [@sedlakova2016; @roman2023; @muranyi2016]. NLLs obtain a large proportion of their protein-bound nitrogen from the atmosphere. On average, they fix 230 kilogram per hectare of atmospheric nitrogen and were documented to obtain above 90% of their nitrogen demand from atmospheric nitrogen [@palmason1992; @evans1987]. Thus NLLs produce high amounts of quality-protein coupled to a low climate-impact.

In addition to diversifying agricultural production through the incorporation of different crop species, diversification can also be achieved by varying the production system itself. A successful approach thereto is to implement annual intercrops, where multiple species are co-cultivated in the same field. This type of intercropping was shown to result in more stable yields, compared with their monoculture equivalents [@raseduzzaman2017; @huang2024]. Mixed cropping, the spatiotemporally coincident cultivation of more than one crop in the same field has proven oneself to be an intercropping system that is particularly suitable to mechanised agriculture, since sowing, field management and harvesting can be performed in the same fashion as with monocrops [@mousavi2011].

Particular attention has been drawn to the annual mixed cropping of pulses with cereals, a combination of crop families which leads to mutual benefit of both crops cultivated [as cited in @landschoot2024; @kumawat2022]. These intercrops exhibit a positive complementarity effect and elevated land use efficiencies, which arises when the mutual resource acquisition is greater than what would be expected from their respective monocrops [@li2020; @yu2015]. The resources used more efficiently by the pulse/cereal intercrops include soil nutrients and photosynthetically active radiation. This increased efficiency is explained by the crops' different shoot and root architectures [@li2020; @loreau2001; @oelbermann2015; @kumawat2022]. 

The predominant improvement in productivity of pulse/cereal intercrops is also accompanied by healthier crops with regards to pest, disease and weed pressure [@trenbath1993]. The underlying mechanism leading to reduced pest pressures is assumed to be owed to increased abundance of predators and parasites, and the host dilution effect through intercropping another (non-host) species [@andow; @lithourgidis; @kumawat2022]. As a result, intercrops exhibited lower pest infestations in 52%, and higher infestations in 15% of the reported studies, compared with monocrops [@andow]. In contrast, the trends with diseases is less clear [@kumawat2022]. While the magnitude and direction of this trend varies depending on the specific intercropping system, diseases involved, and environmental conditions, pulse/cereal intercropping generally still decreased the disease infection by reducing their incidence and spread [@hauggaard-nielsen2008; @malezieux2009; @tooker2012; @finch2000]. Lastly, weed pressure was consistently lower in pulse/cereals intercrops than in their respective pulse monocrops, and in 52% of the studied cases, it lay below their respective cereal monocrops [@verret2017, @huang2024]. Altogether, these resource and host dilution effects explain, why pulse/cereal intercrops exhibit equal or better health and yields than their monocrop equivalent in 74% of the recorded cases, and why pulse/cereal intercrops are the most common intercropping system applied [@verret2017; @rao1987].

Pulse/cereal intercrops with oats as cereal partner are common, and particularly stand out due to the oats strong capacity to suppress weeds and the oats’ advantage in crop rotation to allows for a subsequent cereal cultivation [e.g. @gronle2015; @wang2012; @staniak2014]. Despite the multitude of meta-analyses and reviews evaluating the on-field characteristics and post-harvest performances of pulse/cereal intercrops, less information is available on quality metrics of crop yield in intercropping systems [@liu2023]. With regards to the protein yield, one meta-analysis by @li2023 concluded that the protein yield of intercrops remained stable, compared with the more productive monocrop, given no nitrogen fertiliser was supplied. Similarly, two studies by Begna et al. 2021 and Liu et al. 2023 assessed the forage quality of pulse/cereals intercrops, concluding either equivalent or improved feed quality in intercrops compared with their monocrop equivalents, respectively, which is partially also owed to the high protein yields of the pulses [@begna2021; @liu2023]. Lastly, @bedoussac2010 as well as @lauk reported elevated grain protein contents in durum wheat intercropped with pulses, whereas @hauggaard-nielsen2008 could not detect any effect on the barley protein content when intercropped with NLLs.

A large body of evidence thus supports the implementation of pulse/cereal intercrops, and many aspects of intercropping have been thoroughly assessed for main crops, which includes wheat, pea and maize [@landschoot2024]. However, studies on minor crops, such as NLL/oat intercrops are more limited [@kumawat2022; @li2023]. Furthermore, @dourmap2025 pointed out the need to perform more intercropping research on lupins to unfold their full potential in the agricultural production system. Integrating studies that evaluate and connect field performance, productivity and yield quality of intercropping minor crops are underrepresented [e.g. @hauggaard-nielsen2008], and to the best knowledge of the authors, no study has assessed these parameters across multiple NLL/oat variety combinations yet [@landschoot2024]. 

The current study jointly evaluates on-field performance, productivity metrics and yield quality across multiple NLL/oat variety mixed crops and compares them to their respective monocrops. Compared with the monocrops, we expect the mixed crops to

- have less weeds, pests and diseases, i.e. the plants are healthier
- show equal growth patterns as their monocrops, e.g. plant height or development stage
- exhibit equal or improved land use and productivity
- produce equal or higher amounts of protein per land area, and
- display equal or improved quality parameters (such as thousand kernel weight).
