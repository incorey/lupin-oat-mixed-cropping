<p>The NLL and oat varieties were cultivated in pure and mixed stands. The pure oat varieties were fertilised according to the local guidelines (<a href="#tbl_sites">Table 2</a>). In the mixed stands, each NLL variety was co-cultivated with each oat variety in a replacement design. The NLLs were sown at 90% of their pure stand’s density, whereas the oats, due to their high competitiveness, were sown at 10% of their pure stand’s density <span class="citation" data-cites="kato-noguchi1994 bohm">[@kato-noguchi1994; @bohm]</span> (<a href="#tbl_trt">Table 1</a>).

<p>The fields of this two-year study were arranged as a randomised complete block design (RCBD), consisting of four blocks. To lower the border effect to a minimum, each treatment was sown in three adjacent plots and only the middle plot was scored and harvested. The size of each harvested plot was seven square metres (<a href="#fig-des">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<p>The sites of both years were located in the same two areas in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, Seegräben and Reckenholz, and were chosen based on their differing soil properties. The soils in Seegräben were sandy without free calcium, and pH-values ranging between 6 and 6.5. The soils in Reckenholz were loamy clay, containing some free calcium, and pH-values ranged from 6.8 to 7. <a href="#tbl_sites">Table 2</a> provides an overview of the sites and relevant husbandry measures dates. The fields were amended with 350 kgha<sup>-1</sup> of compost in fall, ploughed three weeks and harrowed one week before sowing, respectively. Less than twelve hours before sowing, the NLL seeds were inoculated with sterile peat inoculum containing the rhizobium bacterium <em>Bradyrhizobium lupinus</em>. The inoculum was produced by Legume Technology Ltd, Nottinghamshire, UK. The same batch of inoculum was used in both years and stored dry and under exclusion of humidity at 10°C. After the inoculation, every 7m<sup>2</sup> plot was sown individually in rows with 18 cm spacing. The plots were sown with a plot sowing tractor and RTK-GPS-orientation. Mechanical weeding was performed after emergence and during early tillering (spring-tine and shallow inter-row cultivation). The pure oats were fertilised during late tillering, before the elongation stage. The crops developed well without the need for any pest or disease control interventions.</p>

<p>Plant growth stages were scored on a daily basis during the flowering period of the NLLs, the ears emergence of the oats and before the harvest of the crops. Soil coverage was scored daily, until the date the crops fully covered the soil (fractional canopy cover &gt; 98%). During the ears emergence of oats and flowering of the NLLs, as well as one week before harvest, average plant height, lodging area percentages of NLLs and oats, and weed volumes were recorded. Weed volume was scored by multiplying the weeds’ fractional canopy cover (FCC), with the weeds’ plant height relative to the plant height of the crop, according to the method proposed by Andújar et al.&nbsp;2016 <span class="citation" data-cites="andujar2016">[@andujar2016]</span>. This scoring method was chosen to obtain a more accurate estimate of the weed pressure compared with scoring the FCC only, and also due to its non-destructive nature. Additionally, the average number of oat tillers were scored on three plants per plot after tillering. Pests and diseases that appeared were scored in the time points of their respective biological relevance (<a href="#tbl_pheno">Table 4</a>)<span class="citation" data-cites="zotero-498">[@zotero-498]</span>. The NLLs determinism at harvest was scored by the percentage of plants that resumed flowering after their first pods were ready to harvest.</p>

<p>The grains were harvested with a plot combine harvester. In a second step, the grains were additionally cleaned in a vertical air sifter (in-house build). The samples were dried to 10% moisture content. In mixed treatments, the oats were separated from the NLLs with a grain cleaner (Westrup, Slagelse, Denmark), where a 6mm oval-cut sieve was deployed. The cleaned samples were weighted to measure the yield, and then repetitively divided using a riffle divider (sample splitter RT6.5, Retsch ltd., Haan, Germany), to obtain representative 150 g samples. These representative samples were analysed for their hectolitre weight (Grain Analysis Computer, Model GAC2100 by DICKEY_John® corporation, Illinois, USA), oat thousand kernel weight (Seed counter MARVIN®, by MARViTECH GmbH, Wittenburg, Germany), and total protein content of oats and NLLs by near-infrared spectroscopy (Infratec NOVA, FOSS analytical, Hilleroed, Denmark).</p>

<p>The (transformed) response variables were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Four model-classes M1-M4 were designed to suit the target-variables (<a href="#tbl_mdls">Table 8</a>). The treatment, year, site, and their interaction effects were modelled as fixed effects and the block within a field as a random effect. The models were fitted using the <code>lme4</code> package within the R programming language <span class="citation" data-cites="bates2015 zotero-47">[@bates2015; @zotero-47]</span>. Inferences were calculated using the lmerTest package, which provides the shatterweights degree of freedom adjustment for the type-III ANOVA and the <code>contest</code>-function, which was used to test linear contrasts <span class="citation" data-cites="kuznetsova2017">[@kuznetsova2017]</span>. The contrast sum parametrisation was used to allow the interpretability of the regression coefficients to the population mean, but partially fitted intercepts were used for each group in case of the M2 and M4 models (R syntax: “y~0+group”). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were performed to assess varietal differences.</p>

<td>M1</td>
<td>This model answered if the response variable differed in mixtures and pure NLLs (or analogously oats) across all varieties. It performed an ANOVA using the NLL/oat-variety and the binary variable stand = mixed. This model considered each species separately.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<tr class="even">
<td>M4</td>
<td>M4 answered the question, if the estimated value of the treatments with mixed stands (e.g.&nbsp;the land equivalent ratio) was significantly different from an expected value (e.g.&nbsp;LER = 1) after a Bonferroni correction (with the respective 12 coefficients).</td>

<p>To mitigate the influence of outliers, the outlier weights were automatically adapted using the weights from the analogous model derived by the <code>rlmer</code> function of the robustlmm package <span class="citation" data-cites="koller2016">[@koller2016]</span>. Target outliers were selected by applying the bounded influence function of huber loss.
