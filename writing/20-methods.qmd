## Varieties

Three branching spring-narrow-leaved lupin (NLL) and three spring-oat varieties were chosen based on the breeders' fact sheets and the variety list of the German variety institute [@zotero-521]. Branching, spring-NLL and early-maturing spring oat varieties were selected to increase the probability of coincidental ripening. The selected, NLL varieties were

- Lunabor, bred by Saatzucht Steinach in Germany
- Probor, bred by Saatzucht Steinach in Germany
- Jowisz (synonym: Jupiter), bred by HR Smolic in Poland

And the selected, early maturing spring oat varieties were

- Bison, bred by Hauptsaaten für die Rheinprovinz GmbH in Germany, medium tall
- Lion, bred by Nordsaat Saatzucht GmbH in Germany in medium tall
- Troll, bred by Saatzucht Bauer GmbH & Co. KG in Germany, short

## Treatments and experimental design
The NLL and oat varieties were cultivated as spring crops in pure and mixed stands. In the mixed stands, each NLL variety was co-cultivated with each oat variety in a replacement design. The NLL were sown at 90% of their pure stand’s density, whereas the oats, due to their high competitiveness, were sown at 10% of their pure stand’s density [@kato-noguchi1994; @bohm] ([Table 1](#tbl_trt)). The sowing amounts were adapted to the germination rate evaluated two weeks before sowing. The germination rate was evaluated according to the international seed testing association (ISTA) protocol. The pure oat stands were fertilised according to the local guidelines amounting to a total of 90 kgha^-1^ available N. Mixed stands were not fertilised.

The fields of this two-year study were arranged as a randomised complete block design (RCBD), consisting of four blocks. To lower the border effect to a minimum, each treatment was sown in three adjacent plots and only the middle plot was scored and harvested. The size of each harvested plot was seven square metres ([Figure 1](#fig-des)).

## Site, husbandry and weather data
The sites of both years were located in the same two areas in the canton of Zurich (Switzerland), Seegräben and Reckenholz, and were chosen based on their differing soil properties. The soils in Seegräben were sandy without free calcium, and pH values ranging between 6 and 6.5. The soils in Reckenholz were loamy clay, containing some free calcium (Table 2), and pH values ranged from 6.8 to 7. [Table 2](#tbl_sites) provides an overview of the sites and dates of relevant husbandry measures. The fields were ploughed three weeks and harrowed one week before sowing, respectively. Less than twelve hours before sowing, the NLL seeds were inoculated with sterile peat inoculum containing the rhizobium bacterium *Bradyrhizobium lupinus*. The inoculum was produced by Legume Technology Ltd. (Nottinghamshire, UK) and marketed under the trade name LegumeFix®. The same batch of inoculum was used in both years and stored dry and under exclusion of humidity at 10°C. After the inoculation, every 7m^2^ plot was sown individually in rows with 18 cm spacing. The plots were sown with a plot sowing tractor and RTK-GPS-orientation. The inoculation was confirmed by the presence of taproot nodules on five randomly sampled plants per plot. Mechanical weeding was performed after emergence and during early tillering on all treatments (spring-tine and shallow inter-row cultivation). The pure oats were fertilised during late tillering, before the elongation stage. The crops developed well without the need for any pest or disease control interventions.

## On-field phenotyping
Plant growth stages were scored on a daily basis during the flowering period of the NLL, during ears emergence of the oats and before the harvest of the crops. Soil coverage was scored daily, until the date the crops fully covered the soil (fractional canopy cover above 98%). During the ears emergence of oats and flowering of the NLL, as well as one week before harvest, average plant height, lodging area percentages of NLL and oats, and weed volumes were recorded. Weed volume was scored by multiplying the weeds' fractional canopy cover (FCC × relative height), with the weeds' plant height relative to the plant height of the crop, according to the method proposed by Andújar et al. 2016. This scoring method was chosen to obtain a more accurate estimate of the weed pressure compared with scoring the FCC only, and also due to its non-destructive nature. Additionally, the average number of oat tillers were scored on three plants per plot after tillering. Pests and diseases that appeared were scored in the time points of their respective biological relevance ([Table 4](#tbl_pheno))[@zotero-498]. The NLL indeterminacy at harvest was scored by the percentage of plants that resumed flowering after their first pods were ready to harvest.

## Harvest and post-harvest analyses
The grains were harvested with a plot combine harvester (WINTERSTEIGER seedmech). In a second step, the grains were additionally cleaned in a vertical air sifter (in-house build). The samples were dried to 10% moisture content. In mixed treatments, the oats were separated from the NLL with a grain cleaner (Westrup, Slagelse, Denmark), where a 6mm oval-cut sieve was deployed. The cleaned samples were weighted to measure the yield, and then repetitively divided using a riffle divider (sample splitter RT6.5, Retsch ltd., Haan, Germany), to obtain representative 150 g samples. These representative samples were analysed for their hectolitre weight (Grain Analysis Computer, Model GAC2100 by Dickey_John® corporation, Illinois, USA), oat thousand kernel weight (seed counter Marvin®, by MARViTECH GmbH, Wittenburg, Germany), and total protein content of oats and NLL by near-infrared spectroscopy (Infratec Nova, FOSS analytical, Hillerød, Denmark).

## Statistical analysis

### Data preparation and calculations
Based on the primary data, productivity metrics were calculated to assess the partial land equivalent ratio of each crop in mixture (pLER<sub>crop</sub>), the land equivalent ratio of the mixture (LER), the total protein yield (Protein_yield<sub>crop</sub>), the partial (pTOI<sub>protein</sub>) and the total protein overyielding (TOI<sub>protein</sub>) [@zustovi2024; @li2023]:

$$
\text{pLER}_{\text{crop}} = \frac{\text{Yield}_{\text{crop, mixed}}}{\text{Yield}_{\text{crop, pure}}} \tag{1}
$$

$$
LER = \text{pLER}_{\text{lupin}} + \text{pLER}_{\text{oat}} \tag{2}
$$

$$
\text{Protein\_yield}_{\text{crop}} = \text{Yield}_{\text{crop}} \times \text{Protein\_content}_{\text{crop}} \tag{3}
$$

$$
\text{pTOI}_{\text{protein, crop}} = \frac{\text{Protein\_yield}_{\text{crop, mixed}}}{\text{Protein\_yield}_{\text{crop, pure}}} \tag{4}
$$

$$
\text{TOI}_{\text{protein}} = \frac{\text{Protein\_yield}_{\text{lupin, mixed}} + \text{Protein\_yield}_{\text{oat, mixed}}}{\max(\text{Protein\_yield}_{\text{lupin, pure}}, \text{Protein\_yield}_{\text{oat, pure}})} \tag{5}
$$

*Pure* and *mixed* refer to the cultivation in monocropping and in mixed cropping, respectively, and *crop* stands for either NLL or oat interchangeably. The metrics compare the mixed cropping system’s land use efficiency, productivity, and protein overyielding relative to their monocropping equivalents.

To further prepare the data for the analysis, differences were calculated between the pure and mixed stands for the

- date when the canopy fully covered the soil
- oat ears emergence
- NLL flowering
- plant developmental stage at harvest according to Zadoks growth stage [@zadoks1974]

If the variance in the response variable was not constant, this response variable was either square-root or log<sub>10</sub>-transformed (as specified in Appendix A in the Supplemental Materials). To analyse the compensatory yield buffering, the partial plot-level yield was evaluated by means of Pearson-correlation.

### Modelling

The (transformed) response variables were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Four model-classes M1-M4 were designed to suit the target-variables ([Table 5](#tbl_mdls)). The treatment, year, site, and their interaction effects were modelled as fixed effects and the block within a field as a random effect.
The models were fitted using the `lme4` package within the R programming language [@bates2015; @zotero-47]. Inferences were calculated using the lmerTest package, which provided the Satterthwaite degree of freedom adjustment for the type-III ANOVA and the `contest`-function, which was used to test linear contrasts [@kuznetsova2017]. The contrast sum parametrisation was used to allow the interpretability of the regression coefficients to the population mean, but partially fitted intercepts were used for each group in case of the M2 and M4 models (R syntax: "y ~ 0 + group"). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons assessed varietal differences.

::: {.table-caption #tbl-mdls}
Statistical models deployed to analyse the data. The characteristics explain the details of the model. Each response variable (attribute, as specified in table S1 in the Supplemental materials) in the present study was analysed with one or more of the models listed in the table (as specified in Appendix A in the Supplemental materials).
:::

| Model    | Characteristics                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| M1       | This model answered if the response variable differed in mixtures and pure NLL (or analogously oats) across all varieties. It performed an ANOVA using the NLL/oat-variety and the binary variable stand = mixed. This model considered each species separately. |
| M2       | M2 answered if the response variable differed in mixtures and pure NLL or oats. Here, this was achieved by computing the linear contrasts of each pure NLL/oat variety with the mean of its respective mixtures. This model considered each species separately. |
| M3       | On the subset of only mixed plots, M3 performed a two-way (mixed) ANOVA with the factors oat variety and NLL variety (adjusting for site, year, and block). This model considered both species together. |
| M4       | M4 answered the question, if the estimated value of the treatments with mixed stands (e.g. LER) was significantly different from an expected value (e.g. LER = 1) after a Bonferroni correction (with the respective 12 coefficients). |

### Robustification
To mitigate the influence of outliers, the outlier weights were automatically adapted using the weights from the analogous model derived by the `rlmer` function of the `robustlmm` package [@koller2016]. Target outliers were selected by applying the bounded influence function of Huber loss. This application of the robustification is indicated in the supplemented materials, Appendix A (robustify = TRUE).
