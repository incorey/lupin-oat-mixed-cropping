  abstract = {Anthracnose is a major disease of lupins in Western Australia (WA). The disease wiped out the WA albus lupin industry in 1996 and since then, anthracnose resistance has been a major focus for WA lupin breeding. In an endeavour to find a source of resistance to anthracnose, all available germplasm in WA was screened against anthracnose in New Zealand over the summer of 1997 and 1998, and resistance was identified in Ethiopian landraces. The resistance was present in many Ethiopian landraces within a close geographical distribution, suggesting a similar genetic basis of resistance. Crosses were made between the resistant landraces and agronomically superior lines. The progeny were tested for anthracnose resistance, yield, seed quality, and other agronomic characters. The most superior line, Andromeda, was released for commercial production in WA. It was developed from an F3-derived single-plant selection of a cross between an anthracnose-resistant landrace P27175 from Ethiopia and a well adapted but highly susceptible WA breeding line 89B10A-14. Andromeda has a significantly higher level of resistance to anthracnose than the previous cv. Kiev Mutant and is recommended in the medium- to low-rainfall area of the northern wheatbelt of WA. Further breeding effort has resulted in significant improvement in the level of resistance within the WA breeding program, and early generation lines are more resistant than advanced lines. The best resistant lines are, however, in a late flowering background and only an incremental improvement has been achieved in combining early flowering with anthracnose resistance, which seems to be a complex process.},

  abstract = {White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is an important grain legume crop in Australia. The anthracnose incursion in the mid-1990s wiped out the white lupin industry in Western Australia (WA). Since then, incorporation of anthracnose resistance has been a major focus in white lupin breeding. After a series of experiments and targeted breeding in WA, high-yielding anthracnose-resistant genotypes were developed. One of these lines, Amira, was released in 2012 as a replacement for the then-benchmark variety Andromeda. Amira is high-yielding and early-maturing and it has substantially improved resistance to anthracnose compared with Andromeda. Its yield and grain quality are similar to Kiev Mutant and it will be suitable for growing in parts of the Northern Agricultural Region of WA where anthracnose risk is moderate to low. With the adoption of this new variety, reliable production of white lupin can recommence in WA. The growing season in WA is characterised by terminal drought, and early flowering is as important as anthracnose resistance. However, combining these traits was difficult and their combination was not achieved at a desired level in earlier work. The incorporation of the early-flowering trait from a different genetic source from France demonstrated that it is possible to combine these traits at an appropriate level. There was no genetic linkage between the two traits, and consequently, new genotypes with earlier phenology and higher levels of resistance than Amira were developed. The combination of early flowering and anthracnose resistance represents a breakthrough that will significantly improve the adaptation and profitability of white lupin production in WA.},

Lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) is a legume that contains a large variety of plant secondary metabolites, which have multiple functions in the plant, e.g. signalling, nodulation and stress response. An untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to investigate how the metabolome of lupin was affected by intercropped barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The only primary metabolite of lupin affected by intercropping was tryptophan. Several secondary metabolites were affected by intercropping in lupin, and five flavonoids were annotated hereof. The flavonoid levels were increased, and tryptophan levels decreased in lupin when intercropped. Two flavonoids are prenylated, and prenylated flavonoids are believed to play a role in the plant's stress response. Furthermore, flavonoids are involved in plant defence and the nodulation process. Thus the present flavonoids may affect regulation of lupin N2-fixation activity.},

  abstract = {The use of depth cameras in precision agriculture is increasing day by day. This type of sensor has been used for the plant structure characterization of several crops. However, the discrimination of small plants, such as weeds, is still a challenge within agricultural fields. Improvements in the new Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor can capture the details of plants. The use of a dual methodology using height selection and RGB (Red, Green, Blue) segmentation can separate crops, weeds, and soil. This paper explores the possibilities of this sensor by using Kinect Fusion algorithms to reconstruct 3D point clouds of weed-infested maize crops under real field conditions. The processed models showed good consistency among the 3D depth images and soil measurements obtained from the actual structural parameters. Maize plants were identified in the samples by height selection of the connected faces and showed a correlation of 0.77 with maize biomass. The lower height of the weeds made RGB recognition necessary to separate them from the soil microrelief of the samples, achieving a good correlation of 0.83 with weed biomass. In addition, weed density showed good correlation with volumetric measurements. The canonical discriminant analysis showed promising results for classification into monocots and dictos. These results suggest that estimating volume using the Kinect methodology can be a highly accurate method for crop status determination and weed detection. It offers several possibilities for the automation of agricultural processes by the construction of a new system integrating these sensors and the development of algorithms to properly process the information provided by them.},

  abstract = {Competitive cereal cultivars are less susceptible than others to weed interference. Their characterization may provide selection criteria that can be used as guidelines to develop new, even more competitive cultivars. Root exudates are a potential means by which competitive cultivars reduce weed growth. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of cereal root exudates on               Brassica kaber               (DC.) L. C. Wheeler growth, to isolate and characterize the allelochemical compounds released by spring cereal cultivars, and to determine if a relation exists between these allelochemicals and cultivar competitiveness. Highly competitive (HC) and lesser competitive (LC) cultivars of four crop kinds (               Triticum aestivum               L. [wheat],               Avena sativa               L. [wild oat], two- and six-rowed               Hordeum vulgare               L. [barley]) were selected based on previous work. Exudates from undisturbed root systems of               B. kaber               and cereals were collected and used in a bioassay test with               B. kaber.               Root exudates were analyzed for 16 common phenolic compounds using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bioassays indicated that cereal exudates had no negative effect on               B. kaber               germination, but all concentrations of cereal root exudates inhibited               B. kaber               root and hypocotyl growth. As cereal root exudate concentration increased,               B. kaber               growth decreased. For each crop kind,               B. kaber               growth inhibition was greater with HC cultivars than with LC cultivars. The root exudates of all crop kinds and cultivars contained benzoic, caffeic, ferulic,               o               -coumaric, and vanillic acids as well as scopoletin. Para-hydroxybenzoic acid was found in exudates from               T. aestivum, A. sativa               , and two-rowed               H. vulgare               cultivars. Para-coumaric acid was not identified in root exudates from LC               H. vulgare               cultivars. Gentisic acid was produced by               A. sativa               and               H. vulgare.               Vanillic and               o               -coumaric acids along with scopoletin may be responsible for the allelopathic effects of               H. vulgare, T. aestivum               , and               A. sativa               cultivars. These three compounds may be useful as possible indicators of allelopathic potential of genotypes under development and thus considered for use in breeding programs.},

In the United States (US) Southern Great Plains, the system is based primarily on high-input annual grass-type crops in monocropping approaches and requires diverse low-input broadleaf crops for strengthening its sustainability. Winter canola (Brassica napus L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) have the potential to provide forage crop diversity options with high forage yields of high quality. Winter canola and pea in mono- and mixed-cropping approaches at seeding ratios of canola/pea at 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 100:0 were studied for yield and quality in 2015 and 2016 in Clovis, New Mexico (NM). Averaged over years, canola--pea at 75:25 and 50:50 seeding ratios produced similar biomass forage yield but higher than mono-pea by 43\% and canola--pea at 25:75 and mono-canola cropping by 8\%. The land equivalent ratio of all mixed-cropping treatments exceeded 1.0, with canola--pea at the 50:50 seeding ratio recording a land equivalent ratio of 1.15, indicating that mixed-cropping systems are better users of land resources. Total digestible nutrients and relative feed value were higher in canola--pea mixed cropping than in mono-canola and mono-pea cropping. Canola--pea mixed cropping achieved high yields (13.3 to 14.7 Mg{$\cdot$}ha-1) with improved forage quality, as well as improved crop and land productivity, with the potential to improve mechanical harvestability of vining pea, and strengthen the diversity and sustainability of forage crop--dairy farming in the Southern Great Plains under limited irrigation input of {\textasciitilde}300 mm.},

Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Northern Germany (Institute of Organic Farming near Hamburg and Institute of Plant and Soil Science at Braunschweig). Two types of blue lupins, the determinate and branched type were cultivated together with spring barley, spring wheat or fodder peas in different seeding ratios (SR): 50\% : 50\%, 62.5\% : 37.5 \% and 75\% : 25\% of the respective pure cropping seeding rate. We present data on total grain yield, yield of blue lupins, yield percentage of blue lupins, protein content, and protein yield. Total grain yield decreased with increasing SR of blue lupins whereas, in contrast, the yield of blue lupins, protein content and protein yield increased. This shows the low competitive ability of blue lupins against the mixed cropping partners, particularly cereals. Therefore, the yield percentage of blue lupins in mixed cropping with cereals did not reach more than 25\%. From the view of plant production and the purpose of animal nutrition the percentage of grain legumes should be higher and comparable to those of other crop mixtures like peas with spring barley or beans with oat.},

A narrow-leafed lupin (cv. Bora) was intercropped with either wheat, barley or a mixture of oats and barley. Weed harrowing was conducted once, before and then after the crop emergence. Nonharrowed control plots were included in the trials. Whole crop harvesting was performed twice with an interval of about two weeks. Each of the two times, half the area of every experimental plot was harvested. Averaged over sites and plant mixtures, the total crop yields increased from 4970 to 7070 kg DM ha-1, at the early and late harvest, respectively. The mixtures of lupins/oats/barley and lupins/barley yielded 470 kg DM ha-1 more than lupins/wheat. At early harvest, no significant difference between mixtures was found regarding weight of lupins. Lupin weight increased significantly when harvest was delayed, and was 750 kg DM ha-1 higher in mixtures containing barley or wheat than in barley/oats. The proportion of lupins in the harvested crop increased in the order lupins/barley/oats {$<$} lupins/barley {$<$} lupins/wheat; the order demonstrating reduced competitive ability against lupins at the seed rates used. Based on biomass, weed-harrowing reduced the content of annual broad-leaved weeds in the harvested crop from 7\% to 4\% without significantly influencing the proportion or weight of lupins.},

  abstract = {Summary             Intercropping is a farming practice involving two or more crop species, or genotypes, growing together and coexisting for a time. On the fringes of modern intensive agriculture, intercropping is important in many subsistence or low-input/resource-limited agricultural systems. By allowing genuine yield gains without increased inputs, or greater stability of yield with decreased inputs, intercropping could be one route to delivering `sustainable intensification'. We discuss how recent knowledge from agronomy, plant physiology and ecology can be combined with the aim of improving intercropping systems. Recent advances in agronomy and plant physiology include better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between crop genotypes and species -- for example, enhanced resource availability through niche complementarity. Ecological advances include better understanding of the context-dependency of interactions, the mechanisms behind disease and pest avoidance, the links between above- and below-ground systems, and the role of microtopographic variation in coexistence. This improved understanding can guide approaches for improving intercropping systems, including breeding crops for intercropping. Although such advances can help to improve intercropping systems, we suggest that other topics also need addressing. These include better assessment of the wider benefits of intercropping in terms of multiple ecosystem services, collaboration with agricultural engineering, and more effective interdisciplinary research.},

  abstract = {Intercropping rationally utilizes land resources and effectively increases soil biodiversity. The enzyme-mediated biological catabolism of soil organic and mineral components is a crucial step in controlling soil carbon and nutrient circulation and fixation in agroecosystems, and those enzymes involved in nitrogen (N) cycling are particularly important. However, when considering different crop combinations, the effects of intercropping on N-targeting enzyme activities remain uncertain. Given such incomplete knowledge of these belowground pro\- cesses and interactions, we synthesized results for three kinds of N-targeting enzyme activities in response to intercropping based on 117 peer-reviewed papers, in which 454 observations were included. We found that intercropping significantly increased the activity of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase by 26.1\%, protease by 10.2\%, and urease by 22.2\%. Our results suggest that the intercropping effect is mediated by responses of the soil microbes to the diversity of soil nutrients under different crop combinations. Soil N availability and crop competition for nutrients between plant crops mediate patterns of microbial nutrient acquisition strategies and secretion of Ntargeting enzymes. Our comprehensive meta-analysis highlights the importance of intercropping for better soil quality and biodiversity and has implications for the role of intercropping in regulating soil carbon dynamics.},

  abstract = {Cultivar mixtures have been proposed as a way to increase diversity and thereby improve plant production, but our understanding of the effects of mixing cultivars on crop diseases and resource-use e"ciency remains fragmentary. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the effects of cultivar mixtures on crop yield, yield stability, resource-use e"ciency, and disease severity compared with monocultures of twelve major crops. We found that, overall, mixing of cultivars increased crop yield by 3.82\%. Yield gains from mixing cultivars were highest in rice (+16.1\%), followed by maize (+8.5\%), and were lowest in barley (+0.9\%) and sorghum (no increase). Temporal yield stability increased with the number of cultivars in the mixtures. Overall, mixing cultivars increased crop biomass, leaf area index, photosynthetic rate, and Water-use e"ciency by 5.1, 7.2, 8.5 and 4.3\%, respectively, and decreased disease incidence by 24.1\%. Cultivar mixtures were more effective in mitigating diseases and increasing yields in studies performed at lower latitudes, higher mean annual temperatures, and higher mean annual precipitation. Our study complements and adds to previous research, indicating that cultivar mixtures reduce crop losses to disease and enhance resource-use e"ciency compared with monocultures globally. We conclude that the targeted use of cultivar mixtures with appropriate management practices can reduce resource and pesticide inputs while maintaining high yields, thereby promoting sustainable and productive agriculture.},

Full irrigation resulted in medium alkaloid content. Drought stress during the vegetative phase increased alkaloid content to 0.094, 0. I92 and 2.55\% of seed dry matter, respectively. At the flowering stage alkaloid content decreased to 0.070, 0.152 and 1.99\%, while drought stress during pod-filling increased alkaloid content for the determinate variety W26 to 0.097\%, but decreased it to 0.161 and 1.98\% for the two indeterminate varieties Polonez and Zubr, respectively. Drought during either flowering or pod-filling resulted in an increased mean seed weight and a reduced number of seed per square metre. Alkaloid content was negatively correlated to seed weight. The alkaloid composition differed for the three genotypes, and was affected by drought treatment. Compared to the bitter variety the sweet varieties were characterized by reduced concentrations of lupanin, 13-hydroxylupanin and angustifolin. whereas spartein, isolupanin and isoangustifolin were little affected.

  abstract = {Significance             The dilution effect hypothesis suggests that diverse ecological communities limit disease spread via several mechanisms. Therefore, biodiversity losses could worsen epidemics that harm humans and wildlife. However, there is contentious debate over whether the hypothesis applies broadly, especially for parasites that infect humans. We address this fundamental question with a formal meta-analysis of {$>$}200 assessments relating biodiversity to disease in {$>$}60 host--parasite systems. We find overwhelming evidence of dilution, which is independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant--herbivore systems. Thus, biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, human-induced declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.           ,              Infectious diseases of humans, wildlife, and domesticated species are increasing worldwide, driving the need to understand the mechanisms that shape outbreaks. Simultaneously, human activities are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits that these patterns are causally related; diverse host communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61 parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density, of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant--herbivore systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.},

A poor understanding of how QAs accumulate hinders the breeding of sweet varieties. Here, we characterize the expression profiles of QA-related genes, along with the alkaloid content, in various organs of sweet and bitter narrow-leafed lupin (NLL, Lupinus angustifolius L.). Special attention is paid to the RAP2-7 transcription factor, a candidate regulator of the QA pathway. We demonstrate the upregulation of RAP2-7 and other QA-related genes, across the aerial organs of a bitter cultivar and the significant correlations between their expression levels, thus supporting the role of RAP2-7 as an important regulatory gene in NLL. Moreover, we showed that the initial steps of QA synthesis might occur independently in all aerial plant organs sharing common regulatory mechanisms. Nonetheless, other regulatory steps might be involved in RAP27-triggered QA accumulation, given its expression pattern in leaves. Finally, the examination of QA-related gene expression in plants infected with Colletotrichum lupini evidenced no connection between QA synthesis and anthracnose resistance, in contrast to the important role of polyamines during plant--pathogen interactions.},

  abstract = {Cropping system diversification through annual intercropping provides a pathway for agricultural production with reduced inputs of fertilizer and pesticides. While several studies have shown that intercrop performance depends on the genotypes used, the available evidence has not been synthesized in an overarching analysis. Here, we review the effects of genotypes in cereal/legume intercropping systems, showing how genotype choice affects mixture performance. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the interactions between genotype and cropping system (i.e., sole cropping vs. intercropping). Data from 69 articles fulfilling inclusion criteria were analyzed, out of which 35 articles reported land equivalent ratio (LER), yielding 262 LER data points to be extracted. The mean and median LER were 1.26 and 1.24, respectively. The extracted genotype {\texttimes} cropping system interaction effects on yield were reported in 71\% out of 69 publications. Out of this, genotype {\texttimes} cropping system interaction effects were significant in 75\%, of the studies, whereas 25\% reported non-significant interactions. The remaining studies did not report the effects of genotype {\texttimes} cropping system. Phenological and morphological traits, such as differences in days to maturity, plant height, or growth habit, explained variations in the performance of mixtures with different genotypes. However, the relevant genotype traits were not described sufficiently in most of the studies to allow for a detailed analysis. A tendency toward higher intercropping performance with short cereal genotypes was observed. The results show the importance of genotype selection for better in cereal/legume intercropping. This study highlights the hitherto unrevealed aspects of genotype evaluation for intercropping systems that need to be tackled. Future research on genotype effects in intercropping should consider phenology, root growth, and soil nutrient and water acquisition timing, as well as the effects of weeds and diseases, to improve our understanding of how genotype combination and breeding may help to optimize intercropping systems.},

  abstract = {Quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are toxic secondary metabolites found within the genus Lupinus, some species of which are commercially important grain legume crops including Lupinus angustifolius (narrow-leafed lupin, NLL), L. luteus (yellow lupin), L. albus (white lupin), and L. mutabilis (pearl lupin), with NLL grain being the most largely produced of the four species in Australia and worldwide. While QAs offer the plants protection against insect pests, the accumulation of QAs in lupin grain complicates its use for food purposes as QA levels must remain below the industry threshold (0.02\%), which is often exceeded. It is not well understood what factors cause grain QA levels to exceed this threshold. Much of the early work on QA biosynthesis began in the 1970--1980s, with many QA chemical structures well-characterized and lupin cell cultures and enzyme assays employed to identify some biosynthetic enzymes and pathway intermediates. More recently, two genes associated with these enzymes have been characterized, however, the QA biosynthetic pathway remains only partially elucidated. Here, we review the research accomplished thus far concerning QAs in lupin and consider some possibilities for further elucidation and manipulation of the QA pathway in lupin crops, drawing on examples from model alkaloid species. One breeding strategy for lupin is to produce plants with high QAs in vegetative tissues while low in the grain in order to confer insect resistance to plants while keeping grain QA levels within industry regulations. With the knowledge achieved on alkaloid biosynthesis in other plant species in recent years, and the recent development of genomic and transcriptomic resources for NLL, there is considerable scope to facilitate advances in our knowledge of QAs, leading to the production of improved lupin crops.},

  abstract = {Quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are toxic secondary metabolites that complicate the end use of narrow-leafed lupin (NLL; Lupinus angustifolius L.) grain, as levels sometimes exceed the industry limit for its use as a food and feed source. The genotypic and environmental influences on QA production in NLL are poorly understood. Here, the expression of QA biosynthetic genes was analysed in vegetative and reproductive tissues of bitter (high QA) and sweet (low QA) accessions. It was demonstrated that sweet accessions are characterized by lower QA biosynthetic gene expression exclusively in leaf and stem tissues than bitter NLL, consistent with the hypothesis that QAs are predominantly produced in aerial tissues and transported to seeds, rather than synthesized within the seed itself. This analysis informed our identification of additional candidate genes involved in QA biosynthesis. Drought and temperature stress are two major abiotic stresses that often occur during NLL pod set. Hence, we assessed the effect of drought, increased temperature, and their combination, on QA production in three sweet NLL cultivars. A cultivar-specific response to drought and temperature in grain QA levels was observed, including the identification of a cultivar where alkaloid levels did not change with these stress treatments.},

  abstract = {Intercropping of legumes and cereals can bring many benefits to agriculture, including an increase in yield and the quality of the crops obtained. In addition, it is possible to reduce mineral fertilization, which can have a positive impact on the environment. The aim of the field research conducted in 2021--2023 in central Poland was to evaluate the yields obtained, the content and yield of total protein and the value of land equivalent ratio in the intercropping of narrowleaf lupine with cereals at different seeding levels of components and variable mineral nitrogen fertilization. The following factors were tested: 1---share of components in the sowing: narrowleaf lupine (NL) 120 seeds m-2; spring barley (SB) 300 seeds m-2; M1---NL 30 + SB 225 seeds m-2; M2---NL 60 + SB 150 seeds m-2; M3---NL 90 + SB 75 seeds m-2; spring triticale (ST) 450 seeds m-2; M4---NL 30 + ST 340 seeds m-2; M5---NL 60 + ST 225 seeds m-2; M6---NL 90 + ST 115 seeds m-2; 2---mineral fertilization with nitrogen 0, 20, 40, 60 kg N ha-1. The most favorable results were obtained with mixtures containing 60 + 150 seeds m2 of narrowleaf lupine + spring barley and 90 + 115 seeds m-2 of narrowleaf lupine + spring triticale. In addition, the favorable results and the lack of significant differences at fertilization of 40 and 60 kg N ha-1 show the possibility of a limited dose of mineral nitrogen fertilization. Sowing narrowleaf lupine with spring barley at a ratio of 60 + 150 seeds m2 or with spring triticale at a ratio of 90 + 115 seeds m-2 and fertilizing with 40 kg N ha-1 can be recommended for agricultural practice. The proposed management technique ensures high yields of good quality and thus can be an interesting solution for sustainable cultivation and be successfully implemented on farms.},

P deficiency reduced seed alkaloid concentrations in sweet, but not in bitter, varieties. Under P deficiency, the alkaloid profile in harvested seed of sweet varieties mimicked that of the bitter variety Fest, with 13-hydroxylupanine dominating over lupanine. With adequate or abundant P, lupanine was the predominant alkaloid in sweet varieties. K deficiency was associated with an 8-fold increase of seed alkaloid concentrations in the sweet variety Danja (from 1000 to 8000 mg kg-1 DM), mostly due to the stimulation of lupanine production. There was a significant interaction between P and K that affected seed alkaloid concentrations in two ways: (i) the inhibitory effect of P deficiency was only apparent under K deficiency and (ii) the lowest seed alkaloid concentrations occurred with abundant K (240 mg K kg-1) and P (60 mg P kg-1). Seed yield of all varieties increased asymptotically with increasing P and reached a maximum at adequate P (30 mg P kg-1). There was no impact of K deficiency on seed yield. In sweet and bitter varieties P supply increased seed N, P and Zn concentrations, but not K. In contrast, seed K concentrations increased and P concentrations decreased with increasing K supply. These findings suggest that P fertiliser should be supplemented with K, to avoid high seed alkaloid concentrations stimulated by asymptomatic K deficiency at high P levels.},

More than 170 species have been described from the New World and only 12 species from Europe, North and East Africa. Wild lupins are bitter and toxic because they produce quinolizidine alkaloids as a means of chemical defence. During domestication, lupins with low alkaloid contents were selected, leading to `sweet' lupins with alkaloid contents below 0.02\% in the protein-rich seeds, which can be used both for human and animal consumption. The domesticated lupins include Lupinus angustifolius, Lupinus albus, Lupinus luteus and Lupinus mutabilis. Blue or narrow-leafed lupin (L. angustifolius) is the most widely cultivated of them, with a worldwide production of more than 1.3 million t. Several challenges remain for lupin breeding, including the improvement of quantitative and qualitative traits, adaptation to alkaline soil and resistance to fungal pathogens.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Intercropping is the simultaneous cultivation of more than one crop species on the same piece of land and is regarded as the practical application of basic ecological principles such as diversity, competition and facilitation. Field experiments were carried out on a sandy loam soil and a sandy soil in Denmark over three consecutive cropping seasons including dual grain legume (pea, faba bean and lupin)--barley intercropping as compared to the respective sole crops (SC). Yield stability of intercrops (IC) was not greater than that of grain legume SC, with the exception of the IC containing faba bean. Faba bean and lupin had lower yield stability than pea and fertilized barley. However, the different IC used environmental resources for plant growth up to 50\% (LER=0.91--1.51) more effectively as compared to the respective SC, but with considerable variation over location, years and crops. The SC performance supported the interspecific interactions within the IC stand. On the sandy loam 13\% greater grain yield of pea cv. Agadir (520 g m               -2               ) was observed as compared to cv. Bohatyr. Faba bean and lupin yielded similarly (340 g m               -2               ) in the sandy loam soil, with decreasing yields on the sandy soil (320--270 g m               -2               ). Nitrogen fixation was very constant in grain legume SC over species and location, varying from 13.2 to 15.8 g N m               -2               , being lowest in peas and highest in faba bean and lupin. The intercropped grain legumes increased the proportion of plant N derived from N               2               -fixation by on average 10--15\% compared to the corresponding SC. However, especially lupin was suppressed when intercropping, with a reduced N               2               -fixation from 15 to 5--6 g N m               -2               . The IC were particularly effective at suppressing weeds, capturing a greater share of available resources than SC. Weed infestation in the different crops was comparable; however, it tended to be the highest in sole cropped faba bean, lupin and unfertilized barley, where the application of urea to barley reduced the weed infestation by around 50\%. Reduction in disease was observed in all IC systems compared to the corresponding SC, with a general disease reduction in the range of 20--40\%. For one disease in particular (brown spot on lupin) disease reduction was almost 80\% in the IC. Intercropping practices offer many advantages but improved understanding of the ecological mechanisms associated with planned spatial diversity, including additional benefits with associated diversity, is needed to enhance the benefits achieved.},

  abstract = {A growing global population, combined with factors such as changing socio-demographics, will place increased pressure on the world's resources to provide not only more but also different types of food. Increased demand for animal-based protein in particular is expected to have a negative environmental impact, generating greenhouse gas emissions, requiring more water and more land. Addressing this ``perfect storm'' will necessitate more sustainable production of existing sources of protein as well as alternative sources for direct human consumption. This paper outlines some potential demand scenarios and provides an overview of selected existing and novel protein sources in terms of their potential to sustainably deliver protein for the future, considering drivers and challenges relating to nutritional, environmental, and technological and market/consumer domains. It concludes that different factors influence the potential of existing and novel sources. Existing protein sources are primarily hindered by their negative environmental impacts with some concerns around health. However, they offer social and economic benefits, and have a high level of consumer acceptance. Furthermore, recent research emphasizes the role of livestock as part of the solution to greenhouse gas emissions, and indicates that animal-based protein has an important role as part of a sustainable diet and as a contributor to food security. Novel proteins require the development of new value chains, and attention to issues such as production costs, food safety, scalability and consumer acceptance. Furthermore, positive environmental impacts cannot be assumed with novel protein sources and care must be taken to ensure that comparisons between novel and existing protein sources are valid. Greater alignment of political forces, and the involvement of wider stakeholders in a governance role, as well as development/commercialization role, is required to address both sources of protein and ensure food security.},

Besides their usage during protein biosynthesis, they also represent building blocks for several other biosynthesis pathways and play pivotal roles during signaling processes as well as in plant stress response. In general, pool sizes of the 20 amino acids differ strongly and change dynamically depending on the developmental and physiological state of the plant cell. Besides amino acid biosynthesis, which has already been investigated in great detail, the catabolism of amino acids is of central importance for adjusting their pool sizes but so far has drawn much less attention. The degradation of amino acids can also contribute substantially to the energy state of plant cells under certain physiological conditions, e.g. carbon starvation. In this review, we discuss the biological role of amino acid catabolism and summarize current knowledge on amino acid degradation pathways and their regulation in the context of plant cell physiology.},

A second experiment was performed in the green house at different temperatures (10, 20 and 30 {$^\circ$}C) using one cultivar in 2006. This experiment confirmed the results of the field experiments as higher temperatures resulted in a higher alkaloid content of the seeds. In a third temperature stress experiment, three cultivars were grown under long day conditions at day/night temperatures of 30 {$^\circ$}C/ 16 {$^\circ$}C and 20 {$^\circ$}C/16 {$^\circ$}C in growth chambers in comparison with an outdoor control at mean temperatures of 15.5 {$^\circ$}C. Like in the other experiments, the seed alkaloid content increased with rising temperature. From these results, it may be concluded that the seed alkaloid content is strongly influenced by the temperature during initiation of flowering up to pod ripening. This has to be taken into account e.g. in trials for cultivar release in which the alkaloid content is a knock-out criterion.},

Grain legumes fix dinitrogen (N               2               ) in symbiosis with soil bacteria and use soil N sources, but often less efficient than cereals. Intercropping grain legumes with cereals may be a means of increasing use efficiency of soil N. Here, we estimate the global sole cropped grain legume acquisition of N from soil to approximately 14.2 Tg N year               -1               , which corresponds to one-third of the global synthetic fertilizer N use (109 Tg N year               -1               ) for all crops, assuming that grain legumes recover on average 40\% of the fertilizer N. Published data from grain legume-cereal intercrop experiments, employing stable               15               N isotope methods, have shown that due to competitive interactions and complementary N acquisition in intercrops, the cereals recover a more than proportional share of the soil N sources. As a consequence, the intercropped legume derives more of its N from the atmosphere, compared with when it is grown as legume sole crop. We estimated that the increased N use efficiency in intercropping can reduce the requirements for fossil-based fertilizer N by about 26\% on a global scale. In addition, our estimates indicate that if all current grain legume sole crops would instead be intercropped with cereals, a potential net land saving would be achieved, when also replacing part of the current cereal sole crop area with intercropping. Intercropping has additional potential advantages such as increased yield stability and yield per unit area, reduced pest problems and reduced requirements for agrochemicals, while stimulating biodiversity. It is concluded that crop diversification by intercropping has the potential to reduce global requirements for synthetic fertilizer N and consequently support the development of more sustainable cropping systems.},

The inhibitory activity of the water-soluble fraction was maximum, followed by that of ethyl ether-soluble and acetone-soluble fraction. An active principle of the water-soluble fraction was isolated and its structure was determined by spectral data as L-tryptophan. L-Tryptophan inhibited the growth of hypocotyls and roots of lettuce seedlings at concentrations greater than 0.03 and 0.1 raM, respectively. These results suggested that t.-tryptophan may be an allelochemical which affects the growth or germination of different plant species.},

This review offers a comprehensive analysis of how the expected expansion of animal production, driven by the rising world population and living standards for more animal-sourced foods, is creating a global shortage of feed protein supply. Because ruminants, chickens, and pigs contribute to 96\% of the global supply of animal protein and aquaculture is growing fast, means of meeting the feed protein requirements of these species are elaborated. Geographic variation and interdependence among China, Europe, and North America in the demand and supply of feed protein are compared. The potential and current state of exploration into alternative feed proteins, including microalgae, insects, single-cell proteins, and coproducts, are highlighted. Strategic innovations are proposed to upgrade feed protein processing and assessment, improve protein digestion by exogenous enzymes, and genetically select feed-efficient livestock breeds. An overall successful and sustainable solution in meeting global feed protein demands will lead to a substantial net gain of human-edible animal protein with a minimal environmental footprint.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in cereal-legume intercropping for sustainable agriculture. As a result numerous papers, including reviews, focus on this topic. Screening this large amount of papers, to identify knowledge gaps and future research opportunities, manually, would be a complex and time consuming task.                                         Materials and methods                                Bibliometric analysis combined with text mining and topic modelling, to automatically find topics and to derive a representation of intercropping papers as a potential solution to reduce the workload was tested. Both common (e.g. wheat and soybean) as well as underutilized crops (e.g. buckwheat, lupin, triticale) were the focus of this study. The corpus used for the analysis was retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus on 5                                    th                                  September 2022 and consisted of 4,732 papers.                                                        Results               The number of papers on cereal-legume intercropping increased in recent years, with most studies being located in China. Literature mainly dealt with the cereals maize and wheat and the legume soybean whereas buckwheat and lupin received little attention from academic researchers. These underutilized crops are certainly interesting to be used as intercropping partners, however, additional research on optimization of management and cultivar's choice is important. Yield and nitrogen fixation are the most commonly studied traits in cereal-legume intercropping. Last decade, there is an increasing interest in climate resilience, sustainability and biodiversity. Also the term ``ecosystem services'' came into play, but still with a low frequency. The regulating services and provisioning services seem to be the most studied, in contrast terms related to potential cultural services were not encountered.                                         Discussion               In conclusion, based on this review several research opportunities were identified. Minor crops like lupin and buckwheat need to be evaluated for their role as intercropping partners. The interaction between species based on e.g. root exudates needs to be further unraveled. Also diseases, pests and weeds in relation to intercropping deserve more attention and finally more in-depth research on the additional benefits/ecosystem services associated with intercropping systems is necessary.},

The results of the research showed that in cases where the yields of post-cereal wheat monocultures were 1500--3000 kg ha-1 vetch-wheat mixed crops (at the seed densities of 50 germinating vetch seeds and 250 germinating wheat seeds per m2) guaranteed an approximate harvest of 3000 kg ha-1, even under no nitrogen fertilisation, provided the total amount of precipitation in the growth period was 300 {\textpm} 50 mm. If the yields of monocultural wheat topped the level of 3000 kg ha-1, mixed crops, however, lost their advantage over wheat monocultures as the latter's grain harvests were greater in those cases. Vetch-wheat mixed crops maintained their advantage over sole crops of wheat insofar as protein yields were concerned, primarily due to the high protein content of vetch. The extra gain in the protein yields of mixed crops compared to wheat monocultures was 100--500 kg ha-1 in our study, and was heavily dependent on the protein levels monocultural wheat was able to produce in each particular case.},

  abstract = {Each of the principal quinolizidine alkaloids (QA) found in both xylem and phloem exudates together with extracts from all component organs collected from bitter (cv. Lupini) and sweet (cv. Ultra) cultivars of Lupinus albus L. were quantified by gas chromatographic analyses throughout reproductive development. In addition to establishing the major translocated QA species estimates for fluxes of QA to developing fruits based on their sap composition and water economy showed that around half of the QA that accumulated in fruit tissues was due to synthesis in situ and half to translocation principally by phloem. Detailed analyses of QA in transport fluids and component organs were extended to reciprocal homo- and hetero-grafts using bitter (cv. Fest) and sweet (cv. Danja) cultivars of L. angustifolius L. These data confirmed that the majority of QA were synthesized in shoot tissues. In both lupin species feeding and analysis of deuterated QA (lupanine and 13-hydroxylupanine) were used as tracers to demonstrate direct redistribution of alkaloids by translocation from mature leaves in phloem.},

In the present study, five popular rice cultivars were selected and ten mixture combinations were made according to the growth period, plant height, grain yield and quality, and pest and disease resistance. Seedlings of the five cultivars and ten mixture combinations (mixed-sowing of the seeds in an equal ratio, then mixed-transplanting and finally mixed-harvesting) were grown in plastic pots in a glasshouse during the early and late growing seasons in 2016.                                         RESULTS                                Compared with the mono-cropping systems in the early and late growing seasons in 2016 (paired                 t                 -test), the mixed-cropping systems increased the rice leaf photosynthetic rate, soil plant analysis development (SPAD) index and total aboveground dry weight. Moreover, mixed-cropping systems improved the number of spikelets per panicle, seed-setting rate, and grain weight per pot and harvest index by 19.52\% and 5.77\%, 8.53\% and 4.41\%, 8.31\% and 4.61\%, and 10.26\% and 6.98\% in the early and late growing seasons, respectively. In addition, mixed-cropping systems reduced chalky rice rate and chalkiness degree by 33.12\% and 43.42\% and by 30.11\% and 48.13\% in the early and late growing seasons, respectively.                                                        CONCLUSION               The SPAD indexes and photosynthetic rates enhanced at physiology maturity in mixed-cropping systems may result in higher grain yield and better grain quality. In general, it was found that mixed-cropping with different rice cultivars has the potential for increasing grain yield and improving grain quality. {\copyright} 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Crop diversification has been put forward as a way to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture without penalizing its productivity. In this context, intercropping, the planned combination of two or more crop species in one field, is a promising practice. On an average, intercropping saves land compared with the component sole crops, but it remains unclear whether intercropping produces a higher yield than the most productive single crop per unit area, i.e., whether intercropping achieves transgressive overyielding. Here, we quantified the performance of intercropping for the production of grain, calories, and protein in a global meta-analysis of several production indices. The results show that intercrops outperform sole crops when the objective is to achieve a diversity of crop products on a given land area. However, when intercropping is evaluated for its ability to produce raw products without concern for diversity, intercrops on average generate a small loss in grain or calorie yield compared with the most productive sole crop (-4\%) but achieve similar or higher protein yield, especially with maize/legume combinations grown at moderate N supply. Overall, although intercropping does not achieve transgressive overyielding on average, our results show that intercropping performs well in producing a diverse set of crop products and performs almost similar to the most productive component sole crop to produce raw products, while improving crop resilience, enhancing ecosystem services, and improving nutrient use efficiency. Our study, therefore, confirms the great interest of intercropping for the development of a more sustainable agricultural production, supporting diversified diets.},

  abstract = {Intercropping, the agricultural practice of cultivating two or more crops in the same space at the same time, is an old and commonly used cropping practice which aims to match efficiently crop demands to the available growth resources and labor. The most common advantage of intercropping is the production of greater yield on a given piece of land by making more efficient use of the available growth resources using a mixture of crops of different rooting ability, canopy structure, height, and nutrient requirements based on the complementary utilization of growth resources by the component crops. Moreover, intercropping improves soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation with the use of legumes, increases soil conservation through greater ground cover than sole cropping, and provides better lodging resistance for crops susceptible to lodging than when grown in monoculture. Intercrops often reduce pest incidence and improve forage quality by increasing crude protein yield of forage. Intercropping provides insurance against crop failure or against unstable market prices for a given commodity, especially in areas subject to extreme weather conditions such as frost, drought, and flood. Thus, it offers greater financial stability than sole cropping, which makes the system particularly suitable for labor-intensive small farms. Besides, intercropping allows lower inputs through reduced fertilizer and pesticide requirements, thus minimizing environmental impacts of agriculture. However, intercropping has some disadvantages such as the selection of the appropriate crop species and the appropriate sowing densities, including extra work in preparing and planting the seed mixture and also extra work during crop management practices, including harvest. The selection of an appropriate intercropping system for each case is quite complex as the success of intercropping systems depend much on the interactions between the component species, the available management practices, and the environmental conditions. Plant breeding can contribute determinedly to increase of productivity of intercropping systems by investigating and exploiting the genetic variability to intercrop adaptation. This paper provides an overall view and evaluation of annual intercropping, summarizing its main advantages supported by a number of key examples from the literature which point out its great value in the context of sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract = {Europe has become heavily dependent on soya bean imports, entailing trade agreements and quality standards that do not satisfy the European citizen's expectations. White, yellow, and narrow-leafed lupins are native European legumes that can become true alternatives to soya bean, given their elevated and high-quality protein content, potential health benefits, suitability for sustainable production, and acceptability to consumers. Nevertheless, lupin cultivation in Europe remains largely insufficient to guarantee a steady supply to the food industry, which in turn must innovate to produce attractive lupin-based protein-rich foods. Here, we address different aspects of the food supply chain that should be considered for lupin exploitation as a high-value protein source. Advanced breeding techniques are needed to provide new lupin varieties for socio-economically and environmentally sustainable cultivation. Novel processes should be optimized to obtain high-quality, safe lupin protein ingredients, and marketable foods need to be developed and offered to consumers. With such an integrated strategy, lupins can be established as an alternative protein crop, capable of promoting socio-economic growth and environmental benefits in Europe.},

Sustainable agriculture is more efficient in use of resources such as soil and water, and is in balance with the environment conditions. Conventional farming and monocropping systems In addition to depletion the natural resource, is caused environmental pollution. Intercropping can be defined as a multiple cropping system that two or more crops planted in a field during a growing season. Intercropping is a ways to increase diversity in an agricultural ecosystem. Ecological balance, more utilization of resources, increases the quantity and quality of products and reduction damage by pests, diseases and weeds will increases with use of intercropping systems. Row-intercropping, mixed- intercropping, strip-intercropping and relayintercropping are most important types of intercropping. Crops yield increases with intercropping due to higher growth rate, reduction of weeds, pests and diseases and more effective use of resources. Pest and disease damage in intercropping is less than pure cropping, due to pest or pathogen attract by the second crop species, Also weeds will be control, when crops in intercropping system have a complementary effect together. Soil fertility increases by using plants of leguminosae family in intercropping, due to the increasing amount of biological nitrogen fixation.},

  abstract = {Alkaloids play an essential role in protecting plants against herbivores. Humans can also benefit from the pharmacological effects of these compounds. Plants produce an immense variety of structurally different alkaloids, including quinolizidine alkaloids, a group of bi-, tri-, and tetracyclic compounds produced by Lupinus species. Various lupin species produce different alkaloid profiles. To study the composition of quinolizidine alkaloids in lupin seeds, we collected 31 populations of two wild species native to Israel, L. pilosus and L. palaestinus, and analyzed their quinolizidine alkaloid contents. Our goal was to study the alkaloid profiles of these two wild species to better understand the challenges and prospective uses of wild lupins. We compared their profiles with those of other commercial and wild lupin species. To this end, a straightforward method for extracting alkaloids from seeds and determining the quinolizidine alkaloid profile by LC--MS/MS was developed and validated in-house. For the quantification of quinolizidine alkaloids, 15 analytical reference standards were used. We used GC--MS to verify and cross-reference the identity of certain alkaloids for which no analytical standards were available. The results enabled further exploration of quinolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis. We reviewed and re-analyzed the suggested quinolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis pathway, including the relationship between the amino acid precursor l-lysine and the different quinolizidine alkaloids occurring in seeds of lupin species. Revealing alkaloid compositions and highlighting some aspects of their formation pathway are important steps in evaluating the use of wild lupins as a novel legume crop.},

Compared to the monocropped, total N fixed per hectare in intercropped lupin declined approximately 50\%, in line with the decrease in seeding rate and dry matter yield. With these high values of N 2 fixation, selection of the reference crop was not a problem; all the cereals, intercropped or grown singly produced similar estimates of N 2 fixed in lupin. It was deduced from the {\textasciitilde}SN data that significant N transfer occurred from lupin to intercropped Italian ryegrass but not to intercropped Westerwoldian ryegrass or to oats. Doubling the {\textasciitilde}SN fertilizer rate from 30 to 60 kg N ha {\textasciitilde}decreased \% Ndfa to 86\% (p {$<$} 0.05), but total N fixed was unaltered. These results indicate that lupin has a high potential for N 2 fixation at low temperatures, and can maintain higher rates of N 2 fixation in soils of high N than many other forage and pasture legumes.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have been performed to study the effect of N fertilization on cereal--legume intercrops, and their results are sometimes conflicting. Our objective was to do a meta-analysis on cereal--legume intercrops testing the effects of N fertilization on land equivalent ration (LER; partial and total LER), yield ratio, and proportion of legume in the mixture of crop grains. This analysis was based on 17 published studies reporting the results of experiments performed in 15 countries on six species of cereals and 10 species of legumes. Experiments were generally based on replacement (50--50, i.e., in the intercrop, each species is sown at half the sowing rate used for the sole crop) or full substitutive (100--100, i.e., the sowing rate for each crop in the intercrop is identical to that for sole crops) designs. Nitrogen fertilization rates ranged from 0 to 180 kg N ha               -1               . The effect of N fertilization and its inter-study variability were analyzed with mixed-effect statistical models, including study as a random effect. Results showed that N fertilization had non-significant effects on average LER and average yield ratio but that the inter-study variability of these effects was large. Nitrogen fertilization was found to significantly decrease the grain proportion of the legume in the mixture and the partial LER of the legume in studies based on C               3               cereal intercrops.

Almost all of the individuals ({$>$}93\%) conducted sieve element phases on the highly susceptible genotype Bo083521AR (low alkaloid content). A reduced occurrence of phloem phases was observed during the 12-h recording on the alkaloid-rich cultivar Azuro, especially for                                A                 .~pisum                              (37.5\%) and                                A                 .~fabae                              (55.0\%). Furthermore, aphids feeding on genotypes with low alkaloid content had in most cases significantly longer sieve element phases than when feeding on resistant genotypes (Kalya: low alkaloid content, yet resistant; Azuro: high alkaloid content, resistant), whereas                                M                 .~albifrons                              showed the longest phloem phase on the alkaloid-rich cultivar Azuro. As most significant differences were found in phloem-related parameters, it is likely that the most important plant factors influencing aphid probing and feeding behavior are localized in the sieve elements. The aphids' feeding behavior on the cultivar Kalya, with a low alkaloid content but reduced susceptibility, indicates that not only the total alkaloid content influences the feeding behavior but additional plant factors have an impact.},

  abstract = {The adverse effects of climate change are significantly decreasing yield levels and yield stability over time in current monocropping systems. Intercropping (IC), i.e. growing more than one species simultaneously in the same field, often increases resource use efficiency and agricultural productivity compared with growing the component crops solely and can enhance yield stability. This meta-analysis of published IC literature quantified and analysed yield stability in IC compared with the respective sole crops, focusing on the effect of intercrop components (e.g. cereal-grain legume, non-cereal-grain legume), experimental patterns (e.g. experiment over years, experiment over locations), IC design (e.g. additive and replacement) and climatic zone (e.g. tropical, subtropical, and temperate). In total, 33 articles were analysed. The coefficient of variation (\%CV) of yields was used for assessing yield stability, with lower CV value indicating higher yield stability. The analysis showed that cereal-grain legume IC (CV = 22.1) significantly increased yield stability compared with the respective grain legume sole crops (CV = 31.7). Moreover, compared with the respective cereal and legume sole crops, IC in the cereal-grain legume systems gave higher yield stability than IC in the non-cereal-grain legume systems. Compared with the respective cereal (CV = 25.3) and legume (CV = 30.3) sole crops, IC (CV = 19.1) in a replacement design had significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) higher yield stability. Also intercropping in replacement design gave more stable yields than IC in an additive design. In tropical regions, cereal sole crops (CV = 26.3) showed lower yield stability than IC (CV = 17.7) and legume sole crops (CV = 21.7). However, IC in all climatic zones showed higher yield stability than both sole crops. Moreover in our analysis, it was found that a higher yield level provided higher yield stability in crop production. Thus, increasing crop diversification through IC of cereals and grain legumes can enhance yield stability and food security, making an important contribution to eco-functional, ecological or sustainable intensification of global food production.},

A literature study covering English-published scientific papers in Scopus from 1980 to 2022 was performed. Biotic, abiotic, and genotypic factors influence the production of these toxic secondary metabolites by lupines. In particular, sweet cultivars with high 13hydroxylupanine and 13-tigloyloxylupanine concentrations, abundant light exposure and standard diurnal cycles, well-watering procedures, relatively cold environment, N-deficient fertilizer with 240 mg K kg{\`A}1 and 60 mg P kg{\`A}1, high soil pH, and organic growing system conditions, are the best options to avoid high global alkaloid content. Results of this study can be used to develop predictive mechanistic models, although there is still the necessity to collect additional data by performing multi-variate studies.},

The objective of this work was to evaluate 22 different blue lupin genotypes for a high protein concentration and low content of antinutritional alkaloids. These genotypes were grown under uniform controlled environmental and soil conditions, and the harvested seeds were evaluated for their composition. The low phosphorus content confirmed that the phytic acid presence was low in lupin, especially compared to other legumes. Furthermore, some of the varieties had less than 200 ppm alkaloids. Lupin proteins were rich in leucine and lysine, with the lowest amino acid concentration being methionine. There were significant differences in the protein concentration and recovery. This work demonstrated that an approach for selection of genotypes should be based on not only agronomic yields but also nutritional phenotypes, driving better decision making on future varietal selection.},

  abstract = {Food safety is a shared responsibility of all actors along the food supply chain. Changes in the primary production system can affect food safety hazards along the supply chain. This highlights the need for a framework that enables primary producers (i.e., farmers) to assess the potential food safety hazards and, if needed, to apply control measures. This paper presents a generic food safety assessment (GFSA) framework that has been developed based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP). The proposed framework was applied to a case study, i.e., the transition from sole cropping of oats to intercropping of oats with lupins. The application of the GFSA framework enabled the evaluation of potential changes in food safety hazards from this transition and the establishment of appropriate control measures. In addition, GFSA users can employ the results to support decision-making process. Our case study showed that implementing GFSA can be challenging for smallholder or individual farmers and may need coordinated action. Finally, effective and transparent communication is critical for managing food safety along the food supply chain, including when changes are implemented in primary production.},

However, variable and high concentrations of quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) may hamper this evolution. This study assessed the fate of QAs when processing Lupinus albus seeds and lupin-based foods, to give a first indi\- cation of the food industry's ability to sufficiently reduce the QA concentration. Typical unit processes, including toasting, dehulling, sterilization (sterilized jarred lupins), oven baking (cookies), frying (chips) and boiling in water (pasta), were simulated on lab-scale. A quantitative determination of five QAs and qualitative screening of other relevant QAs, in the derived fractions and lupin-based foods, was performed with a validated UHPLC-MS/ MS and -HRMS method, respectively. Results revealed that the reduction in quinolizidine alkaloid content is highly dependent on the applied unit process, that QAs appear to be heat stabile, and that the depletion can be attributed to the leaching in cooking water.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            White lupin (               Lupinus albus               L.) is a high-protein grain legume alternative to soybean in Central Europe, but its cultivation is risky due to the fungal disease anthracnose that can cause severe yield damage. In addition, management of seed alkaloids is critical for human nutrition and animal feed. We report on a white lupin collection of genebank accessions, advanced breeding lines and cultivars that was genotyped and phenotypically characterized for anthracnose resistance and seed alkaloids and protein levels. Using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), SeqSNP-targeted GBS, BiomarkX genotyping and Sanger sequencing, a genetic resource of genome-wide SNPs for white lupin was established. We determined anthracnose resistance in two years field trials at four locations with infection rows and measured seed alkaloids and protein levels by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Few white lupin breeding lines showed anthracnose resistance comparable or better than Celina and Frieda, currently the best commercial cultivars in Germany. NIRS estimates for seed alkaloids and protein levels revealed variation in the white lupin collection. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified SNPs significantly associated with anthracnose resistance in the field representing known and new genomic regions. We confirmed the               pauper               locus and detected new SNP markers significantly associated with seed alkaloids. For the first time, we present loci associated with total grain protein content. Finally, we tested the potential of genomic prediction (GP) in predicting the phenotype of these three quantitative traits. Application of results and resources are discussed in the context of fostering breeding programs for white lupin.},

Producing sustainably is therefore becoming central in agriculture and food systems. Legume crops could play an important role in this context by delivering multiple services in line with sustainability principles. In addition to serving as fundamental, worldwide source of high-quality food and feed, legumes contribute to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, as they release 5--7 times less GHG per unit area compared with other crops; allow the sequestration of carbon in soils with values estimated from 7.21 g kg-1 DM, 23.6 versus 21.8 g C kg-1 year; and induce a saving of fossil energy inputs in the system thanks to N fertilizer reduction, corresponding to 277 kg ha-1 of CO2 per year. Legumes could also be competitive crops and, due to their environmental and socioeconomic benefits, could be introduced in modern cropping systems to increase crop diversity and reduce use of external inputs. They also perform well in conservation systems, intercropping systems, which are very important in developing countries as well as in low-input and low-yield farming systems. Legumes fix the atmospheric nitrogen, release in the soil high-quality organic matter and facilitate soil nutrients' circulation and water retention. Based on these multiple functions, legume crops have high potential for conservation agriculture, being functional either as growing crop or as crop residue.},

The first factor was the cultivar of pea (semi-leafless Milva cultivar and with bipinnate leaves Klif cultivar), while the second factor was the percentage of pea in the weight of sown seeds (40, 60 and 80\%). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of weed infestation of the mixtures were carried out with the use of the square-frame method from the surface of 0,5 m2. The studies have shown that the mixtures with 40\% share of legumes had the smallest weed infestation measured by the dry matter of weeds. The mixtures with semi-leafless pea cultivar Milva were somewhat more competitive against the matter of weeds, but such dependency was not recorded in relation to the numbers and composition of the segetal flora. Species diversity of weeds was similar in all mixtures. The most common species, regardless of the percentage of the components and the cultivar of peas were: Stellaria media, Chenopodium album, Galinsoga parviflora and Erigeron canadensis.},

We assess the impact of several diversification practices in cropping systems on above- and belowground biodiversity and ecosystem services by reviewing 98 meta-analyses and performing a second-order meta-analysis based on 5160 original studies comprising 41,946 comparisons between diversified and simplified practices. Overall, diversification enhances biodiversity, pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation without compromising crop yields. Practices targeting aboveground biodiversity boosted pest control and water regulation, while those targeting belowground biodiversity enhanced nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation. Most often, diversification practices resulted in win-win support of services and crop yields. Variability in responses and occurrence of trade-offs highlight the context dependency of outcomes. Widespread adoption of diversification practices shows promise to contribute to biodiversity conservation and food security from local to global scales.},

World-wide, large quantities of nitrogenous fertilizer are applied to ensure maximum crop productivity. However, nitrogen fertilizer application is expensive and negatively affects the environment, and subsequently human health. A strategy to address this problem is the development of crops that are efficient in acquiring and using nitrogen and that can achieve high seed yields with reduced nitrogen input. This review integrates the current knowledge regarding inorganic and organic nitrogen management at the whole-plant level, spanning from nitrogen uptake to remobilization and utilization in source and sink organs. Plant partitioning and transient storage of inorganic and organic nitrogen forms are evaluated, as is how they affect nitrogen availability, metabolism and mobilization. Essential functions of nitrogen transporters in source and sink organs and their importance in regulating nitrogen movement in support of metabolism, and vegetative and reproductive growth are assessed. Finally, we discuss recent advances in plant engineering, demonstrating that nitrogen transporters are effective targets to improve crop productivity and nitrogen use efficiency. While inorganic and organic nitrogen transporters were examined separately in these studies, they provide valuable clues about how to successfully combine approaches for future crop engineering.},

The associational resistance and enemies hypotheses predict that increasing plant diversity in agricultural fields will reduce pest abundance and damage. Ample research has supported these hypotheses by demonstrating that increased plant species diversity can improve insect pest management via bottom--up and top--down mechanisms. In spite of this support, diversification strategies that might contribute to improved pest control and yield have not been widely adopted owing to logistical and financial constraints.                                                     Basic and applied research is increasingly demonstrating the value of intraspecific genetic diversity for improving ecosystem stability and function. Thus, a more practical way of diversifying crop fields may be to increase plant genotypic diversity by planting cultivar mixtures. Our objective is to review the literature documenting the benefits of genotypic diversity for natural and agricultural ecosystems and synthesize the evidence in support of intraspecific diversity as a viable pest management strategy for insect pests of field crops. We found strong support for wide-ranging benefits of genotypic diversity that improved plant fitness and productivity in natural and applied settings.                                                     Multiple lines of evidence converge to support the potential of intraspecific variation to contribute to improve insect pest control. However, very little work has sought to develop empirical support or viable implementation practices in agricultural systems. Thus, implementation of this practice is limited.                                                                          Synthesis and applications                     . Intraspecific plant diversity can improve plant fitness via bottom--up and top--down effects on pest populations and niche partitioning. Further research is required to refine implementation practices and demonstrate value in terms of reduced pesticide use and increased yield. Growers can implement intraspecific crop diversity with minimal financial investment or changes in production practices. As the benefits of biodiversity for yield stability are increasingly recognized, intraspecific diversity is poised to become a prominent and sustainable management tactic.                                                                           ,              Intraspecific plant diversity can improve plant fitness via bottom--up and top--down effects on pest populations and niche partitioning.

  abstract = {Abstract                            In their raw, unprocessed form, lupins have many desirable characteristics for feeding both ruminants and single-stomached animals. An emphasis on these desirable characteristics when formulating diets, combined with an advanced knowledge of how components of lupins can influence nutritional value, will ensure they make a cost-effective contribution to livestock diets. The main lupin species used in livestock diets include               Lupinus albus               ,               L. angustifolius               and               L. luteus.               Supplementation of ruminant diets with lupins has been shown to have many positive effects in terms of growth and reproductive efficiency, comparable with supplements of cereal grain. The true value of lupins in ruminants, however, can only be determined following a better definition of animal requirements and a closer match of ration specifications. Pigs can effectively utilize               L. angustifolius               and               L. luteus               , but detailed research has yet to reveal the reason for poor utilization of diets containing               L. albus.               Poultry can tolerate high levels of lupins in their diets but levels are often restricted to avoid problems associated with excess moisture in the excreta. Variable responses to enzymes have been observed when attempting to rectify this problem. Lupins have unique carbohydrate properties characterized by negligible levels of starch, high levels of soluble and insoluble NSP, and high levels of raffinose oligosaccharides, all of which can affect the utilization of energy and the digestion of other nutrients in the diet. In addition to carbohydrates, an understanding of lupin protein, lipid and mineral composition together with a knowledge of potential anti-nutritional compounds is required if the use of this legume is to be optimized.},

  abstract = {Narrow-leaved lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.), a valuable leguminous crop adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions, has a very short history of domestication. For many centuries it was used mainly as a green manure, since the success and prospects of the multi-purpose use of the species depend on its breeding improvement, in particular, on a particular concentration of alkaloids in seeds and green mass. The first varieties of scientific breeding were created only in the 1930s after the appearance of low-alkaloid mutants. Despite wide prospects for use in various areas of the national economy, unstable productivity and susceptibility to diseases hinder the production of this crop. Obviously, breeders deal only with a small part of the gene pool of the species and limited genetic resources, using mainly low-alkaloid (sweet) genotypes to create new varieties. The genetic potential of the species can be used more efficiently. At the same time, it is rational to create highly alkaloid (bitter) varieties for green manure, while food and feed varie\-ties should not lose their adaptive potential, in particular, resistance to pathogens, due to the elimination of alkaloids. In this regard, it seems to be a productive idea to create `bitter/sweet' varieties combining a high content of alkaloids in the vegetative organs and low in seeds, which can be achieved by regulating the synthesis/transport of alkaloids in the plant. The paper discusses the current state of use of the species as a green manure, fodder, food plant. Information is given on the quantity and qualitative composition of narrow-leaved lupine alkaloids, their applied value, in particular, fungicidal, antibacterial, insecticidal, the use of lupine alkaloids as active principles of drugs. Along with promising breeding considerations, the possibility of using technologies for processing raw high-alkaloid materials with the accompanying extraction of valuable ingredients for pharmaceuticals is discussed. Information is briefly presented about the genomic resources of the species and the prospects for their use in marker-assistant selection and genome editing.},

Nevertheless, determining rates and controls of BNF is crucial to placing anthropogenic changes to the N cycle in context, and to understanding, predicting and managing many aspects of global environmental change. Here, we estimate terrestrial BNF for a pre-industrial world by combining information on N fluxes with               15               N relative abundance data for terrestrial ecosystems. Our estimate is that pre-industrial N fixation was 58 (range of 40--100) Tg N fixed yr               -1               ; adding conservative assumptions for geological N reduces our best estimate to 44 Tg N yr               -1               . This approach yields substantially lower estimates than most recent calculations; it suggests that the magnitude of human alternation of the N cycle is substantially larger than has been assumed.},

However, in such cases it is often taken for granted that a zero-inflated model is required, and the goodness-of-fit to count distributions with and without zero inflation is not often compared for abundance data.},

The effect is reduced in chloramphenicol-treated samples but unimpaired in cycloheximide-treated assays.

  abstract = {California has some of the key agricultural regions in the United States. One of these key regions, San Joaquin Valley, frequently experiences severe droughts leading to shortage of irrigation water. This has a significant impact on the agricultural based economy of the region. It is imperative to develop new strategies to reduce overall water consumption in agriculture without affecting crop yield. A large fraction of irrigation water is lost due to the evapotranspiration (ET) process in the crops and the soil. The classical Penman-Monteith model has been used in the present work to analyze the effect of different environmental variables and water saving strategies on the ET. Some of the scenarios considered show potential for significant water savings without much reduction in the amount of sunlight available to facilitate crop growth. The central idea considered in this study is the use of canopy shading to cover the crop field resulting in reduction in the ET. Among the strategies considered, the most promising strategy is to partially cover the crop field for a certain part of the day by employing a partially covering retractable canopy. Based on numerical calculations, total reduction in ET is calculated to be 37\% from June to August for the partially covering retractable canopy.},
